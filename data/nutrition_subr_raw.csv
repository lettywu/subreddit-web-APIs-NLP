Is there anything else that is important to the production of these enzymes such as minerals or fats? How should someone adjust their diet to optimise their health?",2020-12-25 17:32:01

nutrition,"Go with the Flow: Improve Circulation  

Occasionally, everyone experiences “pins and needles” where an arm or foot “fall asleep.” Often the result of poor positioning, the sensation occurs when blood to the area is interrupted. The discomfort subsides after vigorous rubbing or shaking of the extremity to restore blood circulation. These isolated incidents are not typically a cause for concern. However, poor circulation might be.

*Circulation Information*

Blood circulation transports nutrients throughout the body, helps manage waste production, improves muscle recovery after a workout, and accelerates healing. Healthy circulation maximizes these functions by improving blood flow via vessels, arteries, veins, and capillaries. When circulation is compromised by disease or other factors, muscles easily atrophy and numbness and tingling frequently occur. Infections develop more easily. Poor circulation increases risk for serious health threats, including stroke, hypertension, and kidney failure. In extreme cases, death can result.

nutrition,"Do high-carbohydrate diets increase satiety? Why or why not? I read some relevant articles and it seems that there is no clear answer because not enough studies have been done, and because of the diverse subtypes of carbohydrates and several complicated factors that can determine appetite (which itself isn't easily measured). 

One particular article from 2001 was quite comprehensive on this: [Carbohydrates, Appetite and Feeding Behavior in Humans](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/10/2775S/4686468#111891761)

&gt;The effects on appetite and energy balance of the vast range of specific carbohydrate subtypes are almost unknown at this level. Some carbohydrates may constrain intake because they limit digestibility of foods (35). They may not elevate satiety, which adds further to the heterogeneity of feeding and motivational responses.  
&gt;  
&gt;As has been discussed throughout this article, numerous confounding effects need to be controlled when comparing the effects of different carbohydrates on appetite, feeding behavior and energy balance. These effects include the energy density of foods; presence of other nutrients in foods; moisture content of foods being compared; sensory attributes of foods; and psychological, physiological and genetic predisposition of the subjects being studied

And also,

&gt;The general perception that all carbohydrates are protective against weight gain seems to be far less secure than was generally supposed in the past decade. There is clearer evidence now that some carbohydrates can elevate energy intake by both nutritional and sensory mechanisms. 

I would really appreciate some clarification as to whether or not there is a general effect of the quantity of carbs in one's diet on appetite? 

It's important to me because it's part of a chemistry course I am undertaking, which states that a high-carb/low-fat diet generally results in less accumulation of body fat than a low-carb/high-fat diet (IK that the amount of fat may have independent effects on satiety) and that high-carb diet generally aids in satiety.

Any insights are really appreciated.",2020-12-23 20:25:06

nutrition,"What is the biological mechanism that causes the reduction in the TEF whilst in a deficit? Hi there, 

I've read about the body's natural response mechanisms to a caloric deficit via reduction in metabolism through reduced NEAT and BMR- these both make sense mechanically, NEAT because you have less energy available 'ambiently' and BMR because you just have less mass in general. What makes less sense to me is how the body reduces the TEF whilst in a deficit, as far as I'm aware TEF is directly related to the energy required to digest each macronutrient, so how does the body adjust to use less energy to breakdown the same macronutrient ( i.e becomes more efficient at digestion, right?). 

In a similar vein, we know the TEF of protein, for example, is anywhere from 25-35%, what kind of % reduction are we looking at whilst in a deficit? Is it substantial or would it be minor?

nutrition,"Sodium's effects on health are contradictory Sodium is an essential mineral of the human body and the major cation of the extracellular fluid. It regulates fluid balance, blood pressure, and cellular homeostasis by regulating plasma volume and cellular transport.

Sodium serves many physiological functions and is necessary for health. Humans can obtain sufficient sodium from the low amounts present in many foods, including fresh meat, fish, and vegetables, but most of the sodium we now consume is added in food processing or at the table.

Sodium chloride (NaCl) or salt has also been used as a preservative for centuries and is now added for flavoring during food preparation. Salt is an excellent preservative because it reduces the water activity of foods, which is the amount of unbound water available for microbial growth and chemical reactions.

Salt can also alter the texture of meats, such as in brining, which can produce a juicier product, while increasing the taste and palatability of the food. The mean body content of sodium in the adult male is 92 gr., with half of this (46 gr.) being located in the extracellular fluid, 11 gr. being found in the intracellular fluid, and 35 gr. being found in the skeleton.

The concentration gradient between the extracellular and intracellular fluid is maintained by the activity of the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump. The sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump, found ubiquitously in all animal cells, transfers sodium and potassium, respectively, from inside to outside the cell, and vice versa, against the concentration gradient, using the energy supplied by ATP (adenosine triphosphate).

In the polarized cells of the renal tubular epithelium or the intestinal wall, sodium enters the cell from the tubular lumen or from the gut, through specific channels and other transport mechanisms. Afterward, it is extruded from the cell into the adjacent capillaries, again, through the action of the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump, which is mainly distributed on the basolateral sides of the cell.

In these types of epithelial cells, sodium transport is mostly facilitated along with other substrates, such as phosphates, amino acids, glucose, and galactose.

Eventually, I fell back into my old habits, but less than before (maybe one 12oz can instead of 2), I would say that was about 6 months or so after the new year.

Usually I drink Diet Coke, because that is what my parents always have around the house since I was young. I have no issues when drinking Diet Coke, outside of the sugar rush/caffeine and sugar crash that are normal. But as I became more lax, I started to drink  20oz Coke bottles on my sunday trip to the market. Recently, if I drink Coke, be it the bottle size or something like a medium drink from fast food, I start to feel nauseous after a few hours, not just the usual sugar rush/crash.

Now this feeling always dissipates after 15 minutes or so, but it seems odd that only classic coke seems to affect me this poorly (I used to always drink coke vanilla, but I am unsure how it affects me now).

I do not have diabetes, as far as I know I am a healthy and young, and I do light cardio every other day or so. I am also well aware of how nutritionally bankrupt soda is, it became a delicacy that returned to being a habit.

This is mentioned in Greg's video on Will Tennyson's 20k calorie challenge.([3:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvgPvukGp8w))

Let's say your maintenance cal is 3000 and you go keto for 30 days and become completely carb depleted, meaning your glycogen stores are all zeroed out. Then on day 31, you decide to cheat with carbs, so you eat 3000 calories (which is your maintenance) of mostly carbs and then also eat 2000 extra. So your total for that day is 5000. 

You would expect to gain around 2000/3500 extra lbs of fat (neglecting the added food thermic effect and other variables), but Greg doucette says that those extra 2000 would actually be stored in your glycogen. I think this assumes the body can store about 500g of glycogen. Meaning you can eat 5000 can not gain any form of fat!

 Now first, is this true or no?

Second, if it is true, I thought it was calories in calories out, so that extra 2k calories would be stored as fat, but if they are not and instead are stored as glycogen, why is that? Does this also explain why Greg might be carbing up on 5000+ calories before his show day?","Greg Doucette said that if you are carb depleted, and you have a carb cheat day where you eat excess calories, any excess energy up to 2000 extra cal above your maintenance will be stored as glycogen?","This is mentioned in Greg's video on Will Tennyson's 20k calorie challenge.([3:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvgPvukGp8w))

Your secret is also that you are so easy to make right-  cut in half, remove the seeds, face down on foil in a 350 oven for a bit over and hour and... scoop! The rest is destiny. Will you remain pure and perfect as you are, eaten straight out of the oven? Or will you transform into one of your many happy recipes? 

Your varieties are delightful, my little butternut. My pleasing pumpkin. My always-true acorn. My newest love, kabocha. My tease spaghetti. I could go on (and on). The shapes are so pleasing and whole, your flesh colors are bright and rich; a perfect creamy orange, or a zingy and perfectly ""stringy""   
 yellow. 

And, my darling, you are inexpensive and have a fantastic shelf life. It is not often you sit on the counter for long, but if you do, when I pick you up you are ready. A couple of dollars and you will grace my lunches for a work week, as you keep cooked in the fridge like a dream.

nutrition,"Should one bulk with surplus calories coming from fats or carbohydrates? What about blood sugar spikes? [https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/)

Hello, I have a question about this article concerning the ""surplus fats"" approach versus the ""high-carb/low-fat"" approach. I am trying to decide which approach is best for maximizing muscle gain while minimizing fat loss on a bulk. I am also considering the repercussions of each approach on overall health and cognitive function.

&amp;#x200B;

The article is very interesting and I encourage you to read it for more context to my question, but here are the approaches in a nutshell:

High-carb/low-fat approach: eating adequate amounts of protein and fat with the rest of your calories (including the caloric surplus) coming from carbohydrates.

Surplus fats approach: eating adequate amounts of protein and carbohydrates (adequate meaning enough to refill glycogen stores) with the rest of your calories (including the caloric surplus) coming from fats.

The article also lists a low-carb/high-fat approach, which I am not considering.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my question:

On the ""HCLF"" diet, should one be worried about the negative affects on blood sugar levels associated with consuming so many carbs (often 500+ grams)? It seems like constantly spiking your blood sugar would not be healthy as it is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. On the other hand, with the ""surplus fats"" diet, I am thinking that including more fats will help reduce these blood sugar spikes by slowing digestion. I am also thinking this will bring cognitive benefits, because one will not be experiencing the side effects of constant, drastic rises and falls in blood sugar.

Is this concern even relevant for non-diabetic athletes who constantly utilize glycogen in their workouts? Will their increased insulin sensitivity plus depleted glycogen stores naturally reduce these blood sugar spikes? Even with 500+ grams of carbohydrates?

Here's an example of how a lectin agglutinates in the body. Let's say a Type A person eats a plate of lima beans. The lima beans are digested in the stomach through the process of acid hydrolysis. However, the lectin protein is resistant to acid hydrolysis. It doesn't get digested, but it stays intact. It may interact directly with the lining of the stomach or intestinal tract, or it may get absorbed into your blood stream along with the digested lima bean nutrients.

I had a macro consultation with an RD because I’d like to become more lean/toned/fit — whatever you’d like to call it — and I wasn’t seeing results from my current eating/workout routine. 

As a 5’ 6”, 140-145lbs. F, I was recommended to eat at  just over 1800 calories and to work on a structured progressive overload program. Up until this point, I ate around 1500-1600 calories a day, with a mix of 45 min HIIT/LISS workouts 5 days/week.

My question here is two-fold: 

1) Is that kind of increase (despite typically being considered a deficit for someone of my size/activity level) going to cause weight gain? I feel like I get mindfucked with metabolism stuff haha. 

2) Is there a point where I should be concerned whether I’m gaining weight appropriately (ex. fat vs. muscle, or if I’m somehow gaining too much (or what would too much be??))?

nutrition,"Seriously, how many calories are in Pinto Beans? I noticed that the nutrition facts (calories specifically) on dried pinto beans seem to vary wildly between brands. So I made a spreadsheet of 10 brands of dried pinto beans with their serving size, calories per serving, and calories per 100 grams. All of the nutrition information is straight off the back of the bag for dried beans.

Casserole claims that their pinto beans are 167 calories per 100 grams, while Goya and Iberia claim that 100 grams of their pinto beans are a whopping 341 calories per 100 grams - more than double that of Casserole! Additionally, only Goya and Iberia have the same calories per serving as one another, while all of the other 8 brands are different from one another and fall somewhere along the spectrum of 167-341 calories per 100 grams.

These are all dried pinto beans. All of the brands list 1/4 cup as the serving size, but one brand says 49 grams is 1/4 cup, another brand claims a paltry 28 grams is 1/4 a cup. Again, all of the serving sizes in grams from the other brands fall somewhere in that spectrum. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup and filled it with dried pinto beans (locally grown beans, no brand) and it weighed 45 grams. 28 grams barely filled the measuring cup halfway. 

I wouldn't be so confused if the calories were a little bit off, but when some brands are literally DOUBLE the calories for the same serving size, I have to wonder what is really going on.

I would love to cook for her/do some light exercise, but how do I encourage her to join me and make it fun? I have some really good recipes to try, but she's used to Americana, casserole, noodle dishes. I'm not buying anything processed but there's already some there, so her options are 1. eat processed foods by herself until she runs out 2. eat my foods, or at least a combination of 1 and 2. She is also a proponent of intuitive eating (very anti-diet, she won't really listen to ""health"" talk even when framed well and out of concern, not contempt), which has caused her to overeat greatly the past few months. This makes it hard for her to find the motivation to exercise, too.

I just don't want to be pushy because I've also struggled with weight/health, but she needs the push - at this point, it's unlikely she'll find the discipline on her own.

nutrition,"Not another fat debate, but just a friendly discussion Since there's already 5,000 existing poly vs mono vs saturated fat threads out there -- I'm not adding another one

What I just read that was really interesting to me is all fatty acids regardless of type have 9 calories per gram

nutrition,"A rant: Frustrated and Upset I just watched a short segment detailing the obesity epidemic in Samoa and it’s left me angry and upset. The footage showed beautiful tropical scenery, rich with local produce and nutritious foods yet an overwhelming percent of the population is overweight or obese (almost 90% i think). 

While traditional Samoan diets are quite healthy, with tropical produce like bananas, coconuts and meat from seafood, the modern Samoan diet is very different. They drink a lot of sugary sodas, candy etc but the real culprit seems to be fatty meats that are imported from other western countries. One particular favored meat is turkey tails..or the extremely fatty oil producing gland of turkeys that comes in from America. If it isn’t enough that Americans have hurt the world in so many ways, now we are also exporting our obesity to less developed countries. In the video they show Samoans as young as 28 with diabetes..many people who’ve had to get their feet amputated as a result. It’s infuriating and sad at the same time. 

While Samoa is an extreme case of obesity unchecked, the rest of the world isn’t immune to this issue either. It hurts me to think that most of this is due to uneducated public. I was fortunate enough to have been raised by a mom who taught me the basics of nutrition at a young age. But lots of other kids aren’t as lucky.

I’m new to this subreddit and was wondering about the amount of carb intakes you would need. I heard that you need around 45%-65% of your total calorie intake. I’m trying to get shredded, so I have mine at 45% of total caloric intake. Yesterday I didn’t even hit 45%. Will that be bad for me? I balance all other macros and still hit the intake caloric maintenance, but I’m afraid my body will start eating at my muscles.

If anyone can provide any insights, that would be awesome!!

Total calories - 2403 (my maintenance calculated through TTDE)


Carbs - 192/264g
Proteins - 195/146g
Fats - 108/78g",2020-12-04 15:02:11

nutrition,"Salt and sodium, how much are you meant to have? So this might be a stupid question but what’s the difference? Google says something like “no more than 2.4g of sodium for an adult, which is 6g of salt per day”

For example, a pack of ready salted crisps has 0.35g of salt. How does that translate to sodium when tracking? There isn’t a salt option, just sodium.

Hi All,

I have gone through cycles of dieting and tracking food with apps like myfitnesspal and I always had an issue with never really knowing how to estimate the weight of the meat I was about to eat so I could count the calories and track it in the app.

There is always the option to use a food scale but I often didn't have access to one (eating out, eating at college cafeteria, etc.).

Would you use an app that can estimate the weight of the meat you are eating? The app would be simple, take a picture of the food(chicken for example) and the app would then estimate the weight of the chicken, say 5oz for example. Then, you would be able to put the 5oz of chicken in your meal tracking app for a more accurate tracking option than just guessing.

Is this something that you would use? If not, I will not waste my time trying to create it lol. A simple yes or no would suffice but feedback on this idea would be well appreciated!",Would this be helpful for you?,"

nutrition,"Does eating in huge bowls/mixing food works against proper nutrition? Due to a complete lack of appetite and sense of taste, im usually a slow eater: i take 1 to 2 hours to have dinner (even though i've been trying to reduce time); meanwhile, i tend to mix different kinds of food from the plates i've preparared. 

For example, i'll take some pieces of a sweet red bell pepper and throw it in a quinoa and corn mix; take some mushrooms and throw them in my rice along with other veggies ecc; and i end up with a huge bowl of stuff. 

I was wondering if this may hinder proper digestion and therefor nutrition: my guess is that the stomach acids won't discriminate and will break each food apart regardless of how you're ingesting it, but honestly im not sure: in the last two weeks that i've been doing this my digestion was clearly hindered (constipation) and it seems like that my body is struggling even more after each meal to digest them this way (my body temperature drops, ecc).  So im wondering if eating things this way can somehow harm absorption and nutrition as well?

nutrition,"Vitamin D: What you need to know Vitamin D is a pro hormone with a plethora of benefits to the human body.  Sadly, in excess of 1 billion people are deficient, worldwide.

The benefits of Vitamin D include:

1. Decreased risk of bone loss and breakage in older age
2. Improved bone health through calcium metabolism and bone morphisms
3. Enhanced immune system
4. Aids fat loss
5. Improves strength
6. Reduces depressive symptoms
7. Associated benefits with cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer

Currently the UK recommended intake of Vitamin D is 600IU per day. Remember, these are recommendations based on an overall population and are not figures to be strived for.

Interestingly the Endocrine Society recommends an intake of 1500-2000IU of vitamin D3 per day, a significant difference and more aligned with optimal health. Most good supplements will have around 4000IU of Vitamin D3, which is a great bench marker, any more is unnecessary and more sunlight exposure will show further significant health benefits.

It is hard to overdose Vitamin D, in fact some studies show that there is an increased risk of vascular calcification (a common ‘reported’ side effect of Vitamin D overdose) from a deficiency rather than an overdose.  however there is limited research to suggest that doses greater than 4000-5000IU elicit any further benefit on a chronic basis.

Deficiency markers cross over with the symptoms of other deficiencies, which is why it is best to adopt a multi disciplinary approach.  Fatigue, feelings of weakness and aches are all symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, but are also markers of dehydration and iron deficiency.  In some cases, vitamin D deficiency leads to and Rickets in children.

&gt;All-cause mortality (deaths per 1000 person-years) decreased across thirds of increasing spermidine intake from 40.5 (95% CI: 36.1, 44.7) to 23.7 (95% CI: 20.0, 27.0) and 15.1 (95% CI: 12.6, 17.8), corresponding to an age-, sex- and caloric intake-adjusted 20-y cumulative mortality incidence of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.51), 0.41 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.45), and 0.38 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.41), respectively.

{...}
&gt;The difference in mortality risk between the top and bottom third of spermidine intakes was similar to that associated with a **5.7-y (95% CI: 3.6, 8.1 y) younger age.**

5.7 year mortality decrease seems insane to me. 

Food sources highest in spermidine include wheat germ, soybean, aged cheddar, and mushroom.

Hi!

Let’s say that one wants to lose fat in order to have his abs showing. A calorie deficit works with removing fat, but is a calorie deficit while eating healthy food more efficient or is losing fat 100% about calories in and out?

nutrition,"I feel just..... Amazing!! Soooo, I for the last idk, pretty much my 21 years of existence have never been one to make sure to drink my 64oz of water a day... or make sure to get my proper nutrition... I basically just ate whatever and didn’t think about the risks... I was never “obese” but I was always a bit overweight. Fast forward to about 3 months ago and I started noticing worsening acid reflux... I didn’t really think about it much because I always had a bit of it and figured I must have just had to much spicy foods, until I starting getting stomach pain and just over all feeling bad pretty much all the time.... finally I decided I should book a doctors appointment to find out what’s going on and if I need any medication to clear up whatever is causing this.

After explaining to my Doctor what was going on she informed me that I more than likely damaged my stomach fairly badly, I was experiencing quite awful burning feelings in my stomach, all over my abdomen, having “unpleasant” bowel movements, etc... so she prescribed me a medication (I believe it was Omeprazole) and told me I need to eat better, take some probiotics and MOST IMPORTANTLY drink more water.... I mean I would say I had gone about 2 months prior to this having maybe 5 bottles of water total in those 2 months and on top of that drinking 4 cans of Mountain Dew and 2 cans of RedBull a day. 

I’ve come to realize how seriously I took this advice... I mean since that day I’ve had maybe 2 cans of pop and 0 energy drinks, haven’t had any fast food since, and have been pretty much only drinking water with the occasional Gatorade Zero because I mean cmon I’m not Perfect haha.

Now, my point here is I’m sure 99% of you folk eat well and don’t need any convincing to do so... but I do however think some of you “Health Nuts” will find it pretty cool to know that I genuinely have never felt better and have never had this much energy, RedBull has nothing on just giving your body the nutrients it needs to work properly haha, I literally wake up and feel like I slept for 48 hours and have consistent good energy all day... I feel healthy and I feel happy... my relationship is better, I’m wayyyy less moody, my skin is better, my recovery from workouts feels like I’m damn Spider-Man, I just feel.....AMAZING.

I will most definitely never go back to those habits haha. This is mostly just a “What’s on your mind” post but I had to just tell someone or in this case someone’s because it’s just so great to feel well, Great!

Hello.  
I keep being confused about Vitamin E, and watching Masterclass with Chris Masterjohn seems to have created more questions than it answered.

The US guidelines of Vitamin E seems to be 15mg per day, at least according to Cronometer.  
The NHS UK recommends 4mg for men and 3mg for women, which is significantly lower than the US guidelines.  
Sweden recommends 10mg for men and 9 mg for women.  
Germany recommends 13-15mg for men, and 12mg for women.

Supposedly they can't all be correct. I know it depends a bit about how much PUFA you are consuming as well, and I try to not go too high above recommendations.

It's just all so confusing, and I would love to be able to lower the 15mg recommendation to make it easier for myself because I am already draining all of my brainpower into trying to create a relatively sustainable weekly food menu that covers all my nutritional needs and is still relatively palatable. But I want to make sure I am really getting all that I need to promote health.

I know some say our need for Vitamin E is exaggerated, but NHS UK's 3-4mg seems extremely low compared to every other guideline I have come across.

Does anyone have a relatively good answer to this? What are our own nutritional goals for Vitamin E?

Thank you.",Confusion about Vitamin E," I accidentally posted this in r/Supplements but meant to post it here, so I hope this is alright.

I know saturated fat is a controversial topic here, but this is a nice little study showing it has the most dramatic effect on increasing “fatty liver” moreso than unsaturated fats or sugars.

SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides.

Salmon, for example, gives anywhere between 150 to 250 calories per 100 g, according to the various websites I've looked up. 

How do I know which sites to trust? Is there a reliable source for nutritional information?


**Note**: I'm not looking for a calorie calculator app, what I'm after is the nutritional values of each ingredient I might want to look up (example: a fruit, a certain type of fish, etc.) Like if I for whatever reason want to compare the nutritional values of a banana and olive oil (2 random examples), it gets difficult when each site gives olive oil different values per 100g...

nutrition,"It baffles me that while proper nutrition is meant to be a staple for good health and well-being, there is a lack of consistency of what ""health"" or ""proper nutrition"" actually is. And at the same time, it feels that the health aspect of proper health is constantly replaced with marketing. I have a long history with nutrition and fitness. 

I do not call myself an expert by any means.

I do however have a psychology degree and I can mostly say from my observations towards nutrition and wellbeing and fitness and reflections from my own experience in the subject.

I must admit, even I struggle to maintain a balance with proper nutrition, especially because I also have my own vices because I am a foodie and I like to eat and experience different cuisines like an adventure or an experience.

At the same time, I also have a rough history with nutrition and fitness.

I was overweight when I was young and while I am not overweight now, I still have those tiny fears of being overweight again even though I (supposedly) know more how to take care of my body and health.

I also had an eating disorder long ago (and maybe a slight obsession with fitness and a bit of orthorexia) and while it is gone now, the temptations and vices still lurks in the back of my mind and I am constantly fighting against it while also questioning whether my actions towards being healthy or disciplined are actually my own choices, or are influenced by voices in the background.

And yes, I also struggle with mental issues and sometimes, food is a comfort, and so is fitness sometimes (in a bad way - a way of feeling like I am in control).


But over the years, I took a deep dive into the whole idea of nutrition and proper health for the sake of cutting out my rough patches and reshaping my mentality towards nutrition and look into the science and back up my habits with verified material rather than what my gut says or based on the rumors and habits that I gained over the years.

And throughout my years of searching into this subject, the more baffled I get.

For starters, it is both interesting and confusing that the ""health"" is very ambiguous and this has become a good opprutunity for people to exploit this into their own interests.

I have encountered many things that are still being debated whether they are healthy or not or useful or not. Heck, even I feel for this throughout my journey- low-fat diets, dietary supplements, fitness routines that have been done by someone who is into fitness instead of someone who is more qualified, fads and unverified research that people still believe or said rumors about (what is using called ""bro science"")

I was even shocked when I learned that the whole idea that fat makes you fat was a big inaccuracy and was pushed by the sugar industry to sell more sugar and we already know the unhealthy side of what sugar does if taken in excess.

And then there are the other complications about maintaining a balance with proper nutrition and diet and fitness- culture.

Let's face it - we live in an era of excess yet at the same time, we are constantly bombarded with ads that capitalise on what we receive from said excesses.

We have choices of many kinds - different foods of every flavour and preference, healthy, non-healthy, small, large and even super large. 

At the same time, we are also exposed with ads about fitness and diets and physical image and abs and muscles and so on.

And this is where I get really confused sometimes and ask ""what do I really want?""

More often than not, the science towards fitness and nutrition is all super complicated and not consistent. Everyone has their own opinions and conclusions and maybe some are financed by the wrong people or people interpret the results differently. 

I keep on realising that the whole idea with health with regards to nutrition and fitness and wellbeing are all so super complicated that is no ""one size fits all"" approach yet I feel as though we are constantly being fed with this but with multiple different ways and patterns while at the same time, being constantly pressured to buy, or look and consume or obsess about many things that may in the end be unhealthy- sugary products, models with certain physiques, fitness cultures with certain unhealthy attitudes towards fitness lifestyle and diet choices.

It is no wonder many people are confused when nutrition and dieting and fitness are involved and no wonder many people end up with eating disorders or mental problems or feeling like they have no control over their own lives when it comes to health.

I am not sure if anyone else experiences or brought this up before but it feels as good my body is constantly fighting against me.

Sometimes it is constipation. Sometimes it is bloating. Sometimes it is mix of both or something else entirely.

I thought that fitness and proper dieting should make this better but for some reason, there is an inconsistency on how this happens - sometimes there are good days, sometimes there are bad days.

And I am a person who, while I have had a rough relationship with fitness and diet (and I am still learning because I am a foodie and also have a bit of a bad history with dieting- eating disorders that still lurk in the back of my mind even though they happened many years ago)

It is as though I am constantly trying to keep my body in line and I have been going through this for years.

It completely interferes with my focus and ruins the feeling of progress throughout my fitness journey (and I also noticed that this issue somehow stops or minimized when I stop working out for a while).

 And at the same time, it constantly interferes with my focus throughout the day as well.

I thought that with better dieting choices and fitness, I should feel more in control or more in touch with my body but for some reason, I still struggle with this.

I have tried many things- diet changes, fibre, remedies that tackle sinus problems, proper sleep (still working on that) meditation in case it is a psychological issue (I also think that this is a highly possible because I suffer from mental health issues and I am probably so self-conscious about this that it paradoxically reinforces itself)

I still have not managed to get to the bottom of this.

I dont think that this is a food intolerance issue (a medical professional told me that food intolerances are made up and not backed up by the medical industry) or maybe it is all in my head that is doing this.

But it is annoying and makes me feel irritated or unable to stay focused during the rest of the day.

Though, his inquiry comes from the fact that he’s been exercising and modifying his diet and have actually seen fat loss and muscle gain BUT his waist circumference has not had any significant decrease. 

Also, he got traumatized because his uncle told him what was wrong with his belly 🤣 (you know, those type of relatives that only point out the negative aspects about you 👀🙄)

nutrition,"Soy protein -&gt; what to do with it?  

Hey,

So I recently stumbled upon this really good offer for natural soy protein isolate and ending up buying 5 kg (not having tried it before). Well after a couple of times of drinking it I've noticed it does not only taste horrible, if you let it stand for more than a minute it starts to bind water and swolling up (which makes it feel like drinking a really thick pancake batter). The thing is, I have about 4.5 kg left which in rough terms is around 4 kg of pure protein (91g protein per 100g). I'm thinking if there is anything else I can do with it like baking, cooking or blending it with something? I've already tried with 2/3 part gainer and 1/3 part soy protein and even that is bad.

Any ideas or similar experience people?

Thanks in advance for any tips!",Soy protein -&gt; what to do with it?,"

The mango and papaya would be the easiest to eat, but is there any nutritional value? Is there a particular way one should eat it - as in, we zest citrus skins instead of just biting and eating.

I have a feeling one could eat watermelon skin just fine - as long as it’s cleaned as it is grown in the dirt. 

But then something like pineapple skin is surely for the compost bin?

Any other skins or peels that are normally thrown out that are good to eat?

Would someone eating vew few carbs, but very high protein reap the benefits of having additional calories burned via the process of gluconeogenisis in addition to protein's thermic effect?

Im guessing adequate fats would need to be consumed to avoid rabbit starvation, but also be kept low enough to not be in a caloric surplus.


Obviously this wouldn't be keto, and I encourage lurkers to take a shot every time someone points out that this would be more than the required protein to build muscle.","Another protein question.

I’d be more interested in a career that isn’t just managing people’s diets, but I’ve searched this sub and know that definitely just a small part of the job. 
Sorry I don’t know how to indent paragraphs. Anything helps, I appreciate it!

It's pretty obvious the Democrat Elite (D.E.) have a stranglehold on this supply chain to ensure Joe Biden survives long enough for Kamala to take over, and also to gift President Trump with a two-years supply so he'll just quietly go even though he was cheated out of the position by several hundred thousand dead democrats; largely ex-republicans who died of 'slightly-worse-than-regular-flu-flu' (lol get wrecked racist douche-bags).

  
So China is sketchy and plus I don't know Hunter Biden well enough to broach the conversation anyway, even though I've seen his dick more times than Mandingo has seen the torn up inside out insides of a borderline anorexic white girls anal cavity/chasm.  


How do you guys propose I go about *legally* acquiring less than two day old infant plasma?

Now I know that depends on which vitamin/mineral we’re talking about but I’ve gotten blood drawn and they give me a panel of which ones I’m deficient in. It seems that there are just so many that by the time I catch up on one, another is deficient. 

There’s so many too. Maybe there’s ones that I are more important than others.",Nutritional deficiencies,"I’m wondering what the effects of vitamin/mineral deficiencies are on the body.

I don’t care much for the “fake sweeteners are unhealthy” arguments nor do I care much for taste so long as it provides sweet flavor (truvia is my fav but too expensive so it’ll settle for sweeteners w a little bit of bitterness)

With this in mind can anyone make recommendations?

nutrition,"What is your favorite carb loading food and why? For me, it's noodles. They're so versatile, so easy to cook once and get perfect reheated results for an entire week, and so tasty. I can go with just olive oil and salt/pep, and I can go all the way to a delicious red, white, or pesto sauce.

Fresh bread tends to lose its luster after just a couple days, unless you toast it (how much toast can you honestly eat though?).

Potatoes are good too, but I think their relative lack of texture limits them.

And most importantly, noodles have a low glycemic index (long-lasting energy) and digest extremely well for myself personally.

This is _not_ a rant! 😂 Tell me your stories...",What is your favorite carb loading food and why?,"For me, it's noodles.
