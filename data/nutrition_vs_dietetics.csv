So, given that, can you eat however much fruit you want with no regard to the sugar content, since sugar is not inherently harmful, or is there still some reason for moderation?

How does nutrition impact the production of these enzymes?  As I understand it enzymes are made from amino acids so getting a variety of different types of proteins is important to ensure that the body has access to amino acids that it can't produce by itself.

I've done this consistently on/off for months. A big part of what makes it feasible are protein powders because they're so low in calories but still let you easily hit protein goals. Some of my highest energy days are the low calories ones, going down to 500-600 even. 12 hours later after waking up and going through the work day, I've still had it in me do work on strength training after finally getting home. 

I strongly get the impression that people are doing it completely wrong and probably aren't aware that many popular food choices such as fruits/oatmeal are in fact low in protein.

1,"Go with the Flow: Improve Circulation  

Occasionally, everyone experiences “pins and needles” where an arm or foot “fall asleep.” Often the result of poor positioning, the sensation occurs when blood to the area is interrupted. The discomfort subsides after vigorous rubbing or shaking of the extremity to restore blood circulation. These isolated incidents are not typically a cause for concern. However, poor circulation might be.

*Circulation Information*

Blood circulation transports nutrients throughout the body, helps manage waste production, improves muscle recovery after a workout, and accelerates healing. Healthy circulation maximizes these functions by improving blood flow via vessels, arteries, veins, and capillaries. When circulation is compromised by disease or other factors, muscles easily atrophy and numbness and tingling frequently occur. Infections develop more easily. Poor circulation increases risk for serious health threats, including stroke, hypertension, and kidney failure. In extreme cases, death can result.

*Help Your Heart*

Vigorous blood flow eases the heart’s function. The simple analogy of a sink with a clogged drain demonstrates the additional effort required to force blood through the body when circulation is poor. Clear passageways with oxygenated blood pulse through the body with less exertion. Hence, the term “runner’s pulse.” Note the optimal standard isn’t called the “couch-potato’s pulse.” Although that sounds relaxing, appearances can be misleading.

1,"Do high-carbohydrate diets increase satiety? Why or why not? I read some relevant articles and it seems that there is no clear answer because not enough studies have been done, and because of the diverse subtypes of carbohydrates and several complicated factors that can determine appetite (which itself isn't easily measured). 

One particular article from 2001 was quite comprehensive on this: [Carbohydrates, Appetite and Feeding Behavior in Humans](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/10/2775S/4686468#111891761)

&gt;The effects on appetite and energy balance of the vast range of specific carbohydrate subtypes are almost unknown at this level. Some carbohydrates may constrain intake because they limit digestibility of foods (35). They may not elevate satiety, which adds further to the heterogeneity of feeding and motivational responses.  
&gt;  
&gt;As has been discussed throughout this article, numerous confounding effects need to be controlled when comparing the effects of different carbohydrates on appetite, feeding behavior and energy balance. These effects include the energy density of foods; presence of other nutrients in foods; moisture content of foods being compared; sensory attributes of foods; and psychological, physiological and genetic predisposition of the subjects being studied

And also,

&gt;The general perception that all carbohydrates are protective against weight gain seems to be far less secure than was generally supposed in the past decade. There is clearer evidence now that some carbohydrates can elevate energy intake by both nutritional and sensory mechanisms. 

I would really appreciate some clarification as to whether or not there is a general effect of the quantity of carbs in one's diet on appetite? 

It's important to me because it's part of a chemistry course I am undertaking, which states that a high-carb/low-fat diet generally results in less accumulation of body fat than a low-carb/high-fat diet (IK that the amount of fat may have independent effects on satiety) and that high-carb diet generally aids in satiety.

Any insights are really appreciated.",2121,307,0.9712

1,"What is the biological mechanism that causes the reduction in the TEF whilst in a deficit? Hi there, 

I've read about the body's natural response mechanisms to a caloric deficit via reduction in metabolism through reduced NEAT and BMR- these both make sense mechanically, NEAT because you have less energy available 'ambiently' and BMR because you just have less mass in general. What makes less sense to me is how the body reduces the TEF whilst in a deficit, as far as I'm aware TEF is directly related to the energy required to digest each macronutrient, so how does the body adjust to use less energy to breakdown the same macronutrient ( i.e becomes more efficient at digestion, right?). 

In a similar vein, we know the TEF of protein, for example, is anywhere from 25-35%, what kind of % reduction are we looking at whilst in a deficit? Is it substantial or would it be minor?

1,"Sodium's effects on health are contradictory Sodium is an essential mineral of the human body and the major cation of the extracellular fluid. It regulates fluid balance, blood pressure, and cellular homeostasis by regulating plasma volume and cellular transport.

Sodium serves many physiological functions and is necessary for health. Humans can obtain sufficient sodium from the low amounts present in many foods, including fresh meat, fish, and vegetables, but most of the sodium we now consume is added in food processing or at the table.

Sodium chloride (NaCl) or salt has also been used as a preservative for centuries and is now added for flavoring during food preparation. Salt is an excellent preservative because it reduces the water activity of foods, which is the amount of unbound water available for microbial growth and chemical reactions.

Salt can also alter the texture of meats, such as in brining, which can produce a juicier product, while increasing the taste and palatability of the food. The mean body content of sodium in the adult male is 92 gr., with half of this (46 gr.) being located in the extracellular fluid, 11 gr. being found in the intracellular fluid, and 35 gr. being found in the skeleton.

The concentration gradient between the extracellular and intracellular fluid is maintained by the activity of the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump. The sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump, found ubiquitously in all animal cells, transfers sodium and potassium, respectively, from inside to outside the cell, and vice versa, against the concentration gradient, using the energy supplied by ATP (adenosine triphosphate).

In the polarized cells of the renal tubular epithelium or the intestinal wall, sodium enters the cell from the tubular lumen or from the gut, through specific channels and other transport mechanisms. Afterward, it is extruded from the cell into the adjacent capillaries, again, through the action of the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump, which is mainly distributed on the basolateral sides of the cell.

In these types of epithelial cells, sodium transport is mostly facilitated along with other substrates, such as phosphates, amino acids, glucose, and galactose.

My first guess would be something like ""fat, salt, sugar, something bitter, and proteins"", assuming water is part of every ingredient for extrusion purposes. Is this at all accurate?

The fat content is mostly sourced from peanuts, chicken and cheese in order from most to least. This is only a new diet implemented so that I maintain a high protein and calorie intake to ensure results from weightlifting.

1,"Should everyone always aim for the commonly recommended protein intake? I’ve just been wondering if EVERYONE that works out in one way or another should aim to consume the commonly recommended protein intake. We all know the general rule is .8-1g of protein per body weight (unless you are doing some specific shit like body recomp), but I can't imagine this being the recommended for every physique. Let's pretend theres a regular gym goer, a powerlifter, a regular newbie, a skinny-fat newbie, a short and overweight, a tall and no fat on body newbie, newbie and a callisthenics trainer, and say that all of these guys weigh the same. Even though everyone one weighs the same on a scale there is no way all these different physiques will have the same body composition; some will have more muscle, some will have more fat, some with higher bone density, some with less, etc. So is it actually necessary for people to follow the general rule of .8-1g of protein per lb of body weight or is there a better way you can approach this if you have access to data from a BMI scan?

I’m any case, I think the biggest conflicting notion is one that promotes saturated fat. They say that saturated fat has no tie to heart disease and does not cause atherosclerosis. I just don’t feel like I can get behind it though; I am nowhere near convinced lard is a part of a healthy diet.

1,"Greg Doucette said that if you are carb depleted, and you have a carb cheat day where you eat excess calories, any excess energy up to 2000 extra cal above your maintenance will be stored as glycogen? This is mentioned in Greg's video on Will Tennyson's 20k calorie challenge.([3:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvgPvukGp8w))

Let's say your maintenance cal is 3000 and you go keto for 30 days and become completely carb depleted, meaning your glycogen stores are all zeroed out. Then on day 31, you decide to cheat with carbs, so you eat 3000 calories (which is your maintenance) of mostly carbs and then also eat 2000 extra. So your total for that day is 5000. 

You would expect to gain around 2000/3500 extra lbs of fat (neglecting the added food thermic effect and other variables), but Greg doucette says that those extra 2000 would actually be stored in your glycogen. I think this assumes the body can store about 500g of glycogen. Meaning you can eat 5000 can not gain any form of fat!

 Now first, is this true or no?

Second, if it is true, I thought it was calories in calories out, so that extra 2k calories would be stored as fat, but if they are not and instead are stored as glycogen, why is that? Does this also explain why Greg might be carbing up on 5000+ calories before his show day?",1308,230,0.9267

1,"How do the sweeteners in Coke Zero Sugar have a harmful effect? I've been learning about the glycemic index and glycemic load and feel I have a good understanding of what they mean.  I've been trying to find out what the GI or GL of a can of Coke Zero Sugar is and came across an article [""What Everyone Must Know About Coke Zero and Diabetes""](https://diabetesmealplans.com/10509/coke-zero-and-diabetes/).  The article says ""... researchers have found that people who regularly consume fake sweeteners have a dramatically increased risk of [metabolic syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17646581).""  The article goes on to say, ""Basically, the more super sweet tasting sodas a person drinks (even if the sweetness is not coming from real sugar), the more they crave that same taste again. This can lead to overeating high calorie, [high carb foods](https://diabetesmealplans.com/5632/top-10-diabetic-foods-to-avoid/), which increase your [blood sugar levels](https://diabetesmealplans.com/5080/diabetes-blood-sugar-levels-chart-printable) and may result in gaining even more weight.""

Here's what I'm not sure about.  If this article is true, is the metabolic syndrome brought on by the mere presence of the artificial sweeteners found in a can of Coke Zero (and the body's reaction to those sweeteners) or is it brought on as a result of eating high calorie and high carb foods which the article claims result from consuming those sweeteners?  If one consumes one or two cans a week but otherwise follows a fairly strict low GI diet, is one still in danger of developing this metabolic syndrome?  Thanks!",1616,244,0.7994

1,"Ode to Winter Squash Oh, winter squash! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...

You have such grand fiber, vitamins and minerals galore!

Your calories defy your nutritional profile and lovely taste and texture- you could make a sweet potato blush.

So sweet and versatile- you can be a hearty soup, roasted and mashed with a little almond milk, dressed up with nuts and a touch of butter or olive oil, made ""spaghetti"", or even dessert! You are just that sweet.

Your secret is also that you are so easy to make right-  cut in half, remove the seeds, face down on foil in a 350 oven for a bit over and hour and... scoop! The rest is destiny. Will you remain pure and perfect as you are, eaten straight out of the oven? Or will you transform into one of your many happy recipes? 

Your varieties are delightful, my little butternut. My pleasing pumpkin. My always-true acorn. My newest love, kabocha. My tease spaghetti. I could go on (and on). The shapes are so pleasing and whole, your flesh colors are bright and rich; a perfect creamy orange, or a zingy and perfectly ""stringy""   
 yellow. 

And, my darling, you are inexpensive and have a fantastic shelf life. It is not often you sit on the counter for long, but if you do, when I pick you up you are ready. A couple of dollars and you will grace my lunches for a work week, as you keep cooked in the fridge like a dream. 

I am sad for you, my sweet. Not everyone knows of your bounty. But I will sing your praises to the end!",1489,280,0.9945

1,"Combating dry lips and mouth from creatine? I've been taking creatine for about 2 and a half weeks and over the last 5 or so days I've gotten constant dry lips and mouth.

I drink about a gallon and a half of water a day (which I track) but the symptoms are constant.

Has anyone dealt with this and successfully gotten passed it? And if so, what worked? Taking it a certain way, etc.?

1,"Are there any (reliable) studies that show little or no correlation between high carb diets and heart disease? I tend to follow a low-carb diet, do some intermittent fasting, the occasional long(ish) fast (2-4 days) etc. I do think that high carb diets are clearly a bad idea for many people, especially those suffering from ""energy toxicity"" diseases such as diabetes, fatty liver disease, obesity. Although I also think this might be multi-factorial - possible damage to the microbiome by sugar-loving pathogens which may also like starch, energy toxicity, inertia, nutritional deficiencies etc. 

I am by no means pro or anti carbs - I do enjoy some parsnips, potatoes, rice, oats and corn, I just don't go overboard with it.

So I just ask if anyone knows of any studies that show long-term high-carb diets with little evidence of heart disease in the person? Thanks.",871,144,-0.269

During ten years of follow-up questions, both those who drank sugary beverages and those who drank artificially sweetened beverages showed greater risk of heart disease.

1,"Should one bulk with surplus calories coming from fats or carbohydrates? What about blood sugar spikes? [https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/)

Hello, I have a question about this article concerning the ""surplus fats"" approach versus the ""high-carb/low-fat"" approach. I am trying to decide which approach is best for maximizing muscle gain while minimizing fat loss on a bulk. I am also considering the repercussions of each approach on overall health and cognitive function.

&amp;#x200B;

The article is very interesting and I encourage you to read it for more context to my question, but here are the approaches in a nutshell:

High-carb/low-fat approach: eating adequate amounts of protein and fat with the rest of your calories (including the caloric surplus) coming from carbohydrates.

Surplus fats approach: eating adequate amounts of protein and carbohydrates (adequate meaning enough to refill glycogen stores) with the rest of your calories (including the caloric surplus) coming from fats.

The article also lists a low-carb/high-fat approach, which I am not considering.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my question:

On the ""HCLF"" diet, should one be worried about the negative affects on blood sugar levels associated with consuming so many carbs (often 500+ grams)? It seems like constantly spiking your blood sugar would not be healthy as it is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. On the other hand, with the ""surplus fats"" diet, I am thinking that including more fats will help reduce these blood sugar spikes by slowing digestion. I am also thinking this will bring cognitive benefits, because one will not be experiencing the side effects of constant, drastic rises and falls in blood sugar.

Is this concern even relevant for non-diabetic athletes who constantly utilize glycogen in their workouts? Will their increased insulin sensitivity plus depleted glycogen stores naturally reduce these blood sugar spikes? Even with 500+ grams of carbohydrates?

***ALL THIS INFO IS DIRECTLY FROM HE WEBSITE***

""We know this because of a factor called **lectins.** Lectins, abundant and diverse proteins found in foods, have agglutinating properties that affect your blood and the lining of your digestive tract. Lectins are a powerful way for organisms in nature to attach themselves to other organisms in nature.

&amp;#x200B;

So, too, with the lectins in food. Simply put, when you eat a food containing protein lectins that are incompatible with your blood type antigen, the lectins target an organ or bodily system (kidneys, liver, gut, stomach, etc.) and can begin to interact with the tissues in that area.

Here's an example of how a lectin agglutinates in the body. Let's say a Type A person eats a plate of lima beans. The lima beans are digested in the stomach through the process of acid hydrolysis. However, the lectin protein is resistant to acid hydrolysis. It doesn't get digested, but it stays intact. It may interact directly with the lining of the stomach or intestinal tract, or it may get absorbed into your blood stream along with the digested lima bean nutrients. Different lectins target different organs and body systems.""",1962,324,0.857

It’s been 48 hours since I’ve had fast food and last night I had a very sharp pain on the right lower abdomen maybe a half inch lower than my bellybutton. It was almost like a pinpoint sized cramp made worse when I stood up completely straight, it subsided after urinating (which I’m guessing is due to decreased bladder pressure but I could be wrong) and while I haven’t had another severe pain I’ve been having mild sharp pains around my lower right abdomen on and off today.

1,"Increasing Calories, but Still in Deficit? Hi all! Quick question based on an experience I had recently. 

I had a macro consultation with an RD because I’d like to become more lean/toned/fit — whatever you’d like to call it — and I wasn’t seeing results from my current eating/workout routine. 

As a 5’ 6”, 140-145lbs. F, I was recommended to eat at  just over 1800 calories and to work on a structured progressive overload program. Up until this point, I ate around 1500-1600 calories a day, with a mix of 45 min HIIT/LISS workouts 5 days/week.

My question here is two-fold: 

1) Is that kind of increase (despite typically being considered a deficit for someone of my size/activity level) going to cause weight gain? I feel like I get mindfucked with metabolism stuff haha. 

2) Is there a point where I should be concerned whether I’m gaining weight appropriately (ex. fat vs. muscle, or if I’m somehow gaining too much (or what would too much be??))? 

For what it’s worth, I’m pretty diligent at weighing and tracking food. :) thanks in advance!",1053,182,0.9892
1,"Is there a maximum amount of calories your body can usefully use, beyond which any excess will just be stored as fat regardless of the calorie deficit? Some background to my question:

I am a cyclist who tracks calorie burn using the kilojoule readings from by the power meter I have on my bike. With this info I feel like I have a good idea of how many calories I burn generally.

On days when I go on long rides I may burn upwards of 6,000 calories but even though I may create a deficit of 500-600 calories I often gain a significant amount of weight the day after. I know a good amount of this could be from water retention but it will often take 3-4 days just to return to the weight I was before the long ride.

So I'm wondering if there is just a maximum amount of calories the body can process regardless of calorie deficit, and if so how to find that number?",867,165,0.8677

As inhabitants of different regions of the globe, we contribute countless dishes to the tables in our homes. In the world of health and fitness, there is a lack of cultural diversity. In order to properly enable the client to maintain a healthy lifestyle, nutritionists need to understand the client’s unique and flavorful cuisine.

Food can be a way to create an identity and should not be lost in the pursuit of healthy meals. The real question is; is there a way to adapt all cultural meals to suit every nutritional plan? Nutritionists need to be aware of the best approach in coaching clients as it can be tough to relate to another person's specific dietary needs. It can be equally complicated for a nutritionist to be completely accommodating to the cultural needs of clients.

Prospects should be able to discover someone that considers their ethnic identity when creating a meal plan or prescription for them. First, let us discuss the different types of nutrition professionals: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Nutritionists are professionals with credentials that allow them to practice nutrition with healthy      individuals. Further, in some states, they must be licensed to work with individuals with medical conditions.  
* Dietitians are licensed professionals who practice with those trying to treat illnesses by      prescription. 
* Coaches/ Meal planners are professionals who are adequately trained within the field of nutrition.      However, they are limited to advising and consulting nutritional programs and cannot prescribe nutrition.

Similar to how, to detox high levels of lead, people sometimes take calcium (which shares with lead the ionic oxidation state of 2+), cholecalciferol, maybe lots of water, maybe also the other most urinary leaky electrolytes like sodium and potassium chloride, and like apparently sometimes even a lead chellant like EDTA?

Arsenic has different chemical properties, though, and is perhaps more related to the biologically active chemical element phosphorus. so could phosphorus maybe have a role similar to how raised calcium traffic through the body can maybe help to carry away lead with it?

1,"Seriously, how many calories are in Pinto Beans? I noticed that the nutrition facts (calories specifically) on dried pinto beans seem to vary wildly between brands. So I made a spreadsheet of 10 brands of dried pinto beans with their serving size, calories per serving, and calories per 100 grams. All of the nutrition information is straight off the back of the bag for dried beans.

Casserole claims that their pinto beans are 167 calories per 100 grams, while Goya and Iberia claim that 100 grams of their pinto beans are a whopping 341 calories per 100 grams - more than double that of Casserole! Additionally, only Goya and Iberia have the same calories per serving as one another, while all of the other 8 brands are different from one another and fall somewhere along the spectrum of 167-341 calories per 100 grams.

These are all dried pinto beans. All of the brands list 1/4 cup as the serving size, but one brand says 49 grams is 1/4 cup, another brand claims a paltry 28 grams is 1/4 a cup. Again, all of the serving sizes in grams from the other brands fall somewhere in that spectrum. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup and filled it with dried pinto beans (locally grown beans, no brand) and it weighed 45 grams. 28 grams barely filled the measuring cup halfway. 

I wouldn't be so confused if the calories were a little bit off, but when some brands are literally DOUBLE the calories for the same serving size, I have to wonder what is really going on.

Hi all, I hope you and your loved ones are well.

What new lifters mean? In every article that I read, they never mention a time frame, are we talking about weeks, months, years?

1,"Encouraging health for sister? Hi! In a few weeks, I will be spending a few weeks with my younger sister. I'm excited, but she's really struggling with health right now. We both have depression and anxiety, which makes it hard for her to cook and do physical activity. She sleeps most of the day and only eats processed foods.

I would love to cook for her/do some light exercise, but how do I encourage her to join me and make it fun? I have some really good recipes to try, but she's used to Americana, casserole, noodle dishes. I'm not buying anything processed but there's already some there, so her options are 1. eat processed foods by herself until she runs out 2. eat my foods, or at least a combination of 1 and 2. She is also a proponent of intuitive eating (very anti-diet, she won't really listen to ""health"" talk even when framed well and out of concern, not contempt), which has caused her to overeat greatly the past few months. This makes it hard for her to find the motivation to exercise, too.

I just don't want to be pushy because I've also struggled with weight/health, but she needs the push - at this point, it's unlikely she'll find the discipline on her own. And I just want to help her get back to her old self, have the energy to enjoy things like she used to. What can I say/do to help her? TIA! :)",1326,247,0.9915

What if all the research is questionable (i.e. both camps -- the ones that demonize saturated fat and promote mono/poly and the other side that demonizes poly saying that everything that is criticized about saturated fat is actually caused by poly lol)

Perhaps all the studies are flawed and the people who eat tons of saturated fat happen to also be people that consume tons of red meat and dont exercise and are overweight, and maybe the study promoting veg oils heavy in omega 6 poly were overall thinner people who exercise and perhaps both fat types have equal impact in reality.

1,"A rant: Frustrated and Upset I just watched a short segment detailing the obesity epidemic in Samoa and it’s left me angry and upset. The footage showed beautiful tropical scenery, rich with local produce and nutritious foods yet an overwhelming percent of the population is overweight or obese (almost 90% i think). 

While traditional Samoan diets are quite healthy, with tropical produce like bananas, coconuts and meat from seafood, the modern Samoan diet is very different. They drink a lot of sugary sodas, candy etc but the real culprit seems to be fatty meats that are imported from other western countries. One particular favored meat is turkey tails..or the extremely fatty oil producing gland of turkeys that comes in from America. If it isn’t enough that Americans have hurt the world in so many ways, now we are also exporting our obesity to less developed countries. In the video they show Samoans as young as 28 with diabetes..many people who’ve had to get their feet amputated as a result. It’s infuriating and sad at the same time. 

While Samoa is an extreme case of obesity unchecked, the rest of the world isn’t immune to this issue either. It hurts me to think that most of this is due to uneducated public. I was fortunate enough to have been raised by a mom who taught me the basics of nutrition at a young age. But lots of other kids aren’t as lucky.

1,"Only non-carb vegetable intake from high pressure pasteurized cold pressed store bought ""greens/reds"" drinks? I do not eat vegtables outside of potatos for the most part. Assume you have no desire/appetite/taste  whatsoever to consume things like beets or spinach or kale etc. Though you do find store bought red/green juice with good ingredients mostly all vegetable, no added sugar, low sugar etc - palatable. 

Is consuming a good quality ""green drink"" accepted vegetable intake replacement when your current vegetable intake is zero and will stay that way as you have no desire to consume vegetables because they are very bad tasting to you? 

Also, fresh juicing would of course be better, but I have found that to be extremely time consuming and not that much more cost efficient when you factor in the time and energy required to juice a fresh 16oz glass of juice every morning when you can buy a fairly good quality cold pressed vegetable juice for $4 US and just drink one every day instead.",1000,170,0.9519

Hi All,

I have gone through cycles of dieting and tracking food with apps like myfitnesspal and I always had an issue with never really knowing how to estimate the weight of the meat I was about to eat so I could count the calories and track it in the app.

There is always the option to use a food scale but I often didn't have access to one (eating out, eating at college cafeteria, etc.).

Would you use an app that can estimate the weight of the meat you are eating? The app would be simple, take a picture of the food(chicken for example) and the app would then estimate the weight of the chicken, say 5oz for example. Then, you would be able to put the 5oz of chicken in your meal tracking app for a more accurate tracking option than just guessing.

Is this something that you would use? If not, I will not waste my time trying to create it lol. A simple yes or no would suffice but feedback on this idea would be well appreciated!",973,184,0.9451

1,"Does eating in huge bowls/mixing food works against proper nutrition? Due to a complete lack of appetite and sense of taste, im usually a slow eater: i take 1 to 2 hours to have dinner (even though i've been trying to reduce time); meanwhile, i tend to mix different kinds of food from the plates i've preparared. 

For example, i'll take some pieces of a sweet red bell pepper and throw it in a quinoa and corn mix; take some mushrooms and throw them in my rice along with other veggies ecc; and i end up with a huge bowl of stuff. 

I was wondering if this may hinder proper digestion and therefor nutrition: my guess is that the stomach acids won't discriminate and will break each food apart regardless of how you're ingesting it, but honestly im not sure: in the last two weeks that i've been doing this my digestion was clearly hindered (constipation) and it seems like that my body is struggling even more after each meal to digest them this way (my body temperature drops, ecc).  So im wondering if eating things this way can somehow harm absorption and nutrition as well?

Please keep in mind im not trying to break rule 2: im just trying to figure out if what im doing is healthy or if i should try to change my habits and just eat each plate apart from each other. 

Thank you!",1288,239,0.9394

1,"Vitamin D: What you need to know Vitamin D is a pro hormone with a plethora of benefits to the human body.  Sadly, in excess of 1 billion people are deficient, worldwide.

The benefits of Vitamin D include:

1. Decreased risk of bone loss and breakage in older age
2. Improved bone health through calcium metabolism and bone morphisms
3. Enhanced immune system
4. Aids fat loss
5. Improves strength
6. Reduces depressive symptoms
7. Associated benefits with cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer

Currently the UK recommended intake of Vitamin D is 600IU per day. Remember, these are recommendations based on an overall population and are not figures to be strived for.

Interestingly the Endocrine Society recommends an intake of 1500-2000IU of vitamin D3 per day, a significant difference and more aligned with optimal health. Most good supplements will have around 4000IU of Vitamin D3, which is a great bench marker, any more is unnecessary and more sunlight exposure will show further significant health benefits.

It is hard to overdose Vitamin D, in fact some studies show that there is an increased risk of vascular calcification (a common ‘reported’ side effect of Vitamin D overdose) from a deficiency rather than an overdose.  however there is limited research to suggest that doses greater than 4000-5000IU elicit any further benefit on a chronic basis.

Deficiency markers cross over with the symptoms of other deficiencies, which is why it is best to adopt a multi disciplinary approach.  Fatigue, feelings of weakness and aches are all symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, but are also markers of dehydration and iron deficiency.  In some cases, vitamin D deficiency leads to and Rickets in children.

Also, I do not live in US. I have a community kitchen btw but it sucks bringing all my cooking utilities over there not to mention I have to bring all my trash back. I've been doing it for awhile but it's tiring and I want a more convenient yet nutritious eats and cheap. Btw, I am also suffering from ED (binge-restrict cycle but lately just binges. I don't go to stores and buy bunches of junk food. Just eat whatever I can find in my room like banana or whatever but it does make me feel really, really awful. It's a rather complicated issue actually) and trying to recover.  


So, today I got an epiphany. Why not just buy a bunches of apples, sweet potatoes, potatoes, eggs and tofus, maybe spinach to make juice. My idea is to just boil those that need to be boiled and put it in my fridge. What do you guys think? I'm annoyed cooking everyday and falling into binges cycles during the busiest, stressful uni time (midterm or finals month) and feeling stressed theres nothing to eat in fridge and that I have to go all the way to the kitchen but I do not feel like buying junks cause it actually adds up in costs and I'd like to avoid that  I'll also be consuming fish oil and vitamin if that helps.

I've been a long-distance runner for several years. This past spring, I started to experience a lot of pain in my stomach - long story (many doctors, ER visits, hospitalizations and tests later) short, I have apparently developed ""functional dyspepsia."" So, over the course of about 6 months, my training volume and diet became extremely restrictive...having gone from training about 100 miles a week and eating a ton, I now am getting anywhere from 30-70 miles a week and feel that I'm not eating very much...so few foods seem to stay down. I've put on about 15 lbs and slowed down quite a lot, and am really distressed about it. I'm also not sleeping well, or eating regular meals. Is the weight gain and loss of endurance a consequence of not getting enough nutrition?

""Cyclamate was banned from use in many countries
because the results of some rat-feeding studies showed the substance to cause bladder tumors. Many scientists questioned the results of the original studies, and this led to many follow-up studies in a variety of
animal species. 
Of note are the results of a 22-year feeding study in monkeys carried out by the National Institutes of Health in the USA that showed that neither cyclamate (nor saccharin) demonstrated any evidence of carcinogenic effects. 
The prevailing opinion today is that neither cyclamate nor cyclohexylamine is likely to be carcinogenic to humans, especially at the levels recommended for diet foods""


""The main reason now that cyclamate is not permitted is that during the follow-up feeding studies to evaluate its carcinogenicity, it was observed that cyclohexylamine, the main metabolite of cyclamate, caused irreversible testicular atrophy in rats.""

I mean I would say I had gone about 2 months prior to this having maybe 5 bottles of water total in those 2 months and on top of that drinking 4 cans of Mountain Dew and 2 cans of RedBull a day. 

I’ve come to realize how seriously I took this advice... I mean since that day I’ve had maybe 2 cans of pop and 0 energy drinks, haven’t had any fast food since, and have been pretty much only drinking water with the occasional Gatorade Zero because I mean cmon I’m not Perfect haha.

Now, my point here is I’m sure 99% of you folk eat well and don’t need any convincing to do so... but I do however think some of you “Health Nuts” will find it pretty cool to know that I genuinely have never felt better and have never had this much energy, RedBull has nothing on just giving your body the nutrients it needs to work properly haha, I literally wake up and feel like I slept for 48 hours and have consistent good energy all day... I feel healthy and I feel happy... my relationship is better, I’m wayyyy less moody, my skin is better, my recovery from workouts feels like I’m damn Spider-Man, I just feel.....AMAZING.

I will most definitely never go back to those habits haha. This is mostly just a “What’s on your mind” post but I had to just tell someone or in this case someone’s because it’s just so great to feel well, Great!

As with l-carnosine, I read it can cause lipofuscin, and this can build up over time and is accelerated with l-carnosine. It’s recommended to take DMAE with the L-carnosine to “flush lipofuscin from your brain and body”..

Hello.  
I keep being confused about Vitamin E, and watching Masterclass with Chris Masterjohn seems to have created more questions than it answered.

The US guidelines of Vitamin E seems to be 15mg per day, at least according to Cronometer.  
The NHS UK recommends 4mg for men and 3mg for women, which is significantly lower than the US guidelines.  
Sweden recommends 10mg for men and 9 mg for women.  
Germany recommends 13-15mg for men, and 12mg for women.

Supposedly they can't all be correct. I know it depends a bit about how much PUFA you are consuming as well, and I try to not go too high above recommendations.

It's just all so confusing, and I would love to be able to lower the 15mg recommendation to make it easier for myself because I am already draining all of my brainpower into trying to create a relatively sustainable weekly food menu that covers all my nutritional needs and is still relatively palatable. But I want to make sure I am really getting all that I need to promote health.

I know some say our need for Vitamin E is exaggerated, but NHS UK's 3-4mg seems extremely low compared to every other guideline I have come across.

Does anyone have a relatively good answer to this? What are our own nutritional goals for Vitamin E?

1,"Maintained Muscle and strength with just food. How is this possible? The last day I’ve ever worked out was March 1, 2020, since then I haven’t touched a single weight or exercised once. My calories have decreased dramatically from 3,000 a day (60% protein, 20% fat, and 20% Carbohydrates.) Body weight as of March 1, 2020 was 165lbs. 

November 25, 2020 my body weight is now 138lbs and I only eat about 1,000 calories a day, if that. The sources of my meals are mainly Carbohydrates (Potatoes, Rice, etc.) I hardly eat any protein (1-2 ounces a day,) and do not exercise at all. 

Lately I’ve noticed a slight decrease in muscle mass as well as a very slight decrease in overall strength despite constantly being in a Caloric Deficit. I do fast for 18+ hours, sometimes 24 hours depending on my mood. During the fasting period I drink Mineral enhanced water and take my supplements. 

Aside from a drastic decrease in my activity and overall calories I feel fine and have noticed an increase in vascularity and lean muscle. I have kept a decent amount of muscle. 

I don’t at all look malnourished either, which is weird. 

With all that said, is it possible that I’ve been able to maintain my muscle and strength with just food?

Is a diet like this moderately healthy considering my lack of calories and or protein consumption?

I also know that there are some micronutrients that help with things in the body, antioxidants and fat soluble compounds like piperine and Diarylheptanoids(like curcumin), and many more secondary metabolites with various effects on the body.

My hairline hasn't moved from pre-hair loss dates. It's the hair behind the hairline all over my scalp and a little thinner on the back and sides. My crown and hairline are fine. It's just I can see my scalp through my hairline because of the hair loss.

Now I'm seeing it's at 6%. Still ascorbic acid.

Thankfully, I am retired now and get my vitamin C from whole foods, but meanwhile still thinking about those out there on watch with bad diets and wondering WHAT IS UP with Clif Bar. Are they trying to save a buck or are we running out of Vitamin C? Maybe it messes with taste? Curious.

Looked this up, and was basically told I'd poisoned myself as this was a 'bitter almond' that contains dangerous levels of cyanide.

On the other hand, other sources say it may just have been a regular almond that has gone bad.

The latter seems more likely as it was supermarket bought, and presumably has to adhere to regulations.

This is about a large dinner plate of whole fruits, vegetables, mushrooms and legumes (leafy greens need a different measurement as they weigh less).

&gt; Similar associations were observed for fruits and vegetables separately. Reductions in risk were observed up to 800 g/day for all outcomes except cancer (600 g/day). Inverse associations were observed between the intake of apples and pears, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and salads and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, and between the intake of green-yellow vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and total cancer risk. An estimated 5.6 and 7.8 million premature deaths worldwide in 2013 may be attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively, if the observed associations are causal.

Has anyone came across any evidence and/or educated suspicions that weekly short fasts (36h in my case) could be bad in some way?

For several months now, I've been doing daily time restricted eating (14:10 or 16:8) followed by around 36h hour fast every Sunday (between dinner on Saturday and Breakfast on Monday). I'm doing that mostly due to the many reported metabolic health benefits rather than a diet (however I do eat at a daily surplus due to my exercise goals, so that's also a way to not build up too much extra fat and build lean muscle mass, in theory at least).

I'm feeling fine and I strongly believe that fasts are a great health tool, but maybe I shouldn't be doing 36h every week, and instead do a similar regimen every two weeks or a month, for instance?

I would like to ask this question because I am not sure if anyone can help me regarding this matter.


I am not sure if anyone else experiences or brought this up before but it feels as good my body is constantly fighting against me.

Sometimes it is constipation. Sometimes it is bloating. Sometimes it is mix of both or something else entirely.

I thought that fitness and proper dieting should make this better but for some reason, there is an inconsistency on how this happens - sometimes there are good days, sometimes there are bad days.

And I am a person who, while I have had a rough relationship with fitness and diet (and I am still learning because I am a foodie and also have a bit of a bad history with dieting- eating disorders that still lurk in the back of my mind even though they happened many years ago)

It is as though I am constantly trying to keep my body in line and I have been going through this for years.

It completely interferes with my focus and ruins the feeling of progress throughout my fitness journey (and I also noticed that this issue somehow stops or minimized when I stop working out for a while).

 And at the same time, it constantly interferes with my focus throughout the day as well.

I thought that with better dieting choices and fitness, I should feel more in control or more in touch with my body but for some reason, I still struggle with this.

I have tried many things- diet changes, fibre, remedies that tackle sinus problems, proper sleep (still working on that) meditation in case it is a psychological issue (I also think that this is a highly possible because I suffer from mental health issues and I am probably so self-conscious about this that it paradoxically reinforces itself)

I still have not managed to get to the bottom of this.

I dont think that this is a food intolerance issue (a medical professional told me that food intolerances are made up and not backed up by the medical industry) or maybe it is all in my head that is doing this.

But it is annoying and makes me feel irritated or unable to stay focused during the rest of the day.

Is there a way to actually tackle this that minimises my risks of losing focus esepcially during workout days and the rest of my days as well?",2328,416,-0.755

This is his question specifically. In my opinion, there’s no such thing as a “belly fat loss diet” as fat loss is not happening specifically at one singular region of the body. Though, his inquiry comes from the fact that he’s been exercising and modifying his diet and have actually seen fat loss and muscle gain BUT his waist circumference has not had any significant decrease.

1,"Soy protein -&gt; what to do with it?  

Hey,

So I recently stumbled upon this really good offer for natural soy protein isolate and ending up buying 5 kg (not having tried it before). Well after a couple of times of drinking it I've noticed it does not only taste horrible, if you let it stand for more than a minute it starts to bind water and swolling up (which makes it feel like drinking a really thick pancake batter). The thing is, I have about 4.5 kg left which in rough terms is around 4 kg of pure protein (91g protein per 100g). I'm thinking if there is anything else I can do with it like baking, cooking or blending it with something? I've already tried with 2/3 part gainer and 1/3 part soy protein and even that is bad.

Any ideas or similar experience people?

Thanks in advance for any tips!",809,151,0.9197

I always assumed that as long as you drank the broth or ate all the gravy you would get back all those lost vitamins. However incoherent, poorly elaborated information online seem to imply that vitamins actually get destroyed, as in their molecular structure is destroyed, by long exposure to heat.

Fish chicken or pork for protein
5 small nugget potatoes
Broccoli or other veg

Snacks of apples, oranges and bananas with sometimes mixed nuts for snacking.

Now I know this is a touchy subject what with 50% of all trade with China being illegal blackmarket sale of infant fetuses grown in underground labs in Wuhan and the DPRK. 

It's pretty obvious the Democrat Elite (D.E.) have a stranglehold on this supply chain to ensure Joe Biden survives long enough for Kamala to take over, and also to gift President Trump with a two-years supply so he'll just quietly go even though he was cheated out of the position by several hundred thousand dead democrats; largely ex-republicans who died of 'slightly-worse-than-regular-flu-flu' (lol get wrecked racist douche-bags).

  
So China is sketchy and plus I don't know Hunter Biden well enough to broach the conversation anyway, even though I've seen his dick more times than Mandingo has seen the torn up inside out insides of a borderline anorexic white girls anal cavity/chasm.  


How do you guys propose I go about *legally* acquiring less than two day old infant plasma? I do have connections to a private lab in Canada willing to synthesise peptides (don't ask it's invite only) and other advanced neutraceuticals, but they charge more than double for 'I Can't Believe It's Not Infant Plasma,' with no money-back guarantee.

0,"Nurses unwilling to accept my quiet nature - anyone else?  

I'm a new RD who started my career in my dream practice setting, the ICU, in September. I love my job, and for the most part I get along with my colleagues, but there are a few nurses who just cannot accept the fact that I am a quiet individual. Today a nurse approached my work station and said ""Orangeyak, you're so quiet. How many months have you been here for? You should make it your new year's resolution to be less quiet."" A few weeks ago, another nurse said something very similar to me, along with ""nobody knows your name because you're so quiet."" In both of these cases, their tone was not in good humour - they were complaining about me, to me. Last week, I overheard one of the charge nurses say ""she's socially awkward... comes in, doesn't say hi to anyone, and just puts her orders in"" and I'm 99% sure she was talking about me.

In my defense, I am 0.5 FTE RD who looks after a 20-bed ICU, fresh out of grad. I don't have time to socialize, let alone finish all my work in the 4 hours/day that I am paid for. Because I'm a 0.5, I also don't go to team rounds, which makes it harder to feel like part of the ICU team. I can eavesdrop on rounds from where I sit in the nursing station, and sometimes the team will call my name and tell me to ""start feeds on \[this patient\],"" but it's not the same as actually sitting at the rounds table.

I make an effort to say ""hi"" and ""bye"" and exchange ""how are you?""s, but rarely will I have a social conversation with any staff member because I am a) focused on getting my work done, and b) introverted. It takes time for me to get to know people and vice versa. Sometimes I will eat lunch in the break room (I normally buy lunch and eat in the caf), but rarely do I find I have anything to contribute to the conversation.

As an introvert, I've had to deal with ""you're so quiet"" all my life. Hearing it from my colleagues has really worn me down. I only have so much energy to give each day, especially in this climate, during this time of year. I never have anything bad to say about anyone and appreciate the personality quirks of all my colleagues, and it just hurts to know that they think I'm too quiet and socially awkward.

Just needed to get that off my chest. Can anyone relate?

I’m a new RD and could really use some feedback on the latest learning experience I’ve had. 

I have a 56 yo F pt with a PEG and a recurring stage 3 pressure ulcer on foot. I’ve been feeling like shit all day because I was re-assessing and I realized that I may have previously gone overboard estimating her nutrient needs. 

Based off the current research I usually do 30-35kcal/kg for PU, more if underweight, etc and 1.2-1.5g/kg protein although I’ve read you can go up to 2g/kg based on stage of wound. 

Anyway I’m just feeling terrible because I estimated her needs to be 2,300kcal/day based off her weight of 172.8 and increased her rate slightly. she has had no significant weight gain/loss in 180 days but has been gradually trending upward. Everything else is stable, she’s tolerating the rate and BM are regular but I can’t shake the feeling of second guessing myself now and I feel paralyzed. 

The thing is she’s bed bound and immobile so I should have known to go lower, previous RD estimated needs at 1700 kcal, even with wound. 

I’m confused because I was taught to use 30-35kcal/kg plus or minus using professional judgement but the older RD I work with asked me why I didn’t use MSJ in a rude way and now I’m wondering when I use MSJ for wounds and when I use kcal/kg.

Earlier this month the MAR system got an update where the supplements are no longer listed on them. I kept asking the nurses and CNAs about whether or not they have given the supplement to patients. A lot of them would tell me: no because they were not on the MAR and they did not know that supplements were ordered for them. It's apparently the night shift's job to write the supplements and EN orders in the new paper MAR, half of them don't do it and supplements would get missed. I'm only there for about 10-16 hours a week and can't effectively monitor when supplements were given (or not). Now my facility has a lot of patients that have wounds or have had major surgeries where I feel missing supplements is hindering patient's healing process. That's why I thought about wanting to implement my own supplement MAR that's easier to keep track of and audit. Has anyone done something like this? I would greatly appreciate any advice you have for me.

0,"Diet And Exercising For Weight Loss   

Obesity is now being called an epidemic in the health community. In fact, it will soon be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, even ahead of cigarette smoking. Obesity leads to type two diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or stroke, and even an increased risk of cancer. With all of these health risks, as well as the general improvement in the quality of life that can occur, losing weight is one of the best things that you can do for yourself.  
 

No matter what we would like to believe, there simply isn’t a magic solution to losing weight. The body will shed excess fat when it needs more calories to function through the demands you place on it in a given day than the amount of calories that you feed it. It’s that simple. So, in order to lose weight, you need to decrease the number of calories that you eat as well as increase the amount that you burn.  
 

There is a wide range of options to choose from when looking for a weight loss program. All of them often spend a lot of time explaining what to eat, in what amounts, and even at what times or in what combinations. But few of them emphasize the importance of exercise – not just for losing weight, but for your general health and wellbeing. Exercise is vital when trying to lose weight for several reasons:  
 

First, as you start to eat less, your metabolism will slow down somewhat. Exercising helps to elevate your metabolism back to an efficient level. Second, as mentioned, the exercise burns more calories so that you can lose weight faster and stay motivated in your efforts. Third, exercise actually releases endorphins, chemicals that keep your mood elevated.  
 

Exercise doesn’t have to mean spending hours at the gym or straining through exhausting workouts. In fact, in order for you to stick with it in the long run, exercising should be something that you enjoy. Start by increasing your activity level in an overall way. Take the stairs when you can. Park further from the mall door when you go shopping. Go for a walk in the park or through a neighborhood you love and bring a dog or a friend along for company. Take dance or martial arts lessons.  
 

Once you become more active in general, you’ll find it easier and more natural to move into regular exercise. Which you’ll need to do eventually in order to get regular, noticeable health benefits. You need to raise your heart rate to a fat-burning level and keep it there for at least 20 minutes, 3 times or more a week. However, if you don’t want to go to a gym, there are other options. Videos and DVDs are now available in all kinds of exercise types. That way you can change your routine whenever you want so that you don’t get bored with what you’re doing. Try a range of aerobics, kickboxing, yoga, or pretty much any activity you want right in the comfort of your own home.  
 

If you have physical limitations that would keep you off from exercising, you can still find a way to increase your activity level. Water aerobics is a wonderful option for those who have joint problems or limited mobility because it relieves the pressure on your body that your weight provides. But you still get the resistance to challenge your muscles from the water. There are even classes and videos available that let you exercise in a seated position.  
 

Whatever kind of exercise you choose, it’s important to stay motivated and keep it fun. Try gathering a group together to make it a social event. Or get a pedometer, a device that tracks how far you walk and see how many miles you can walk a week. Make a competition amongst your friends or family members and treat the winner with something special (not food-related!). Make the experience of exercising something that you look forward to, and it will soon become a regular part of your healthier lifestyle.",3873,703,0.9969

I currently live in New Jersey because it's where I'm from and it's where I get in-state tuition for dietetic school (+I live at home so I don't spend money on rent), but I absolutely hate NJ (cost of living is too damn high + the weather sucks + the culture is icky + I never really planned on moving home in the first place and just wanna put as many miles between me and my hometown as humanly possible) and want to nope the fuck outta here as soon as I get my credential, and preferably for the internship if at all possible.

Im not so sure if dietetics is for me, the classes made the work seem so mundane and boring. I touch on this in my past post.

My undergraduate GPA for DPD Science was 2.75 and overall was 3.0 and received a verification statement in undergrad.

First, I wanted to work in IT. I attended a technical school and gained various certificates related to computer networking and repair services A+, Net + etc. Once I received those certificates and graduated from the program, I went on several interviews and eventually realized this wasn't for me.

I currently hold a Bachelor's in anthropology but am taking prereqs at a community college so that I can apply for accelerated BSN programs next year. But... doubts grip me. When I started on this path of acquiring prereqs, it was with the aim to quickly get my BSN, then go on to get my MSN and become a Nurse Practitioner specializing in women's health. But since then, I've become obsessed with food and nutrition. 

Here are some of the things that I value in my future job/things that interest me: 

* Emphasis on preventative medicine 
* Emphasis on holistic healthcare 
* Advising patients on their diet and lifestyle choices
* Women's health
* Probably working in a non-hospital setting as I don't want the erratic hours
* A decent amount of monetary security
* Easily available jobs -- aka I could move anywhere and find a post with relative ease. 

If anyone has advice about how I can pursue an intersection of these interests, I would be very appreciative!",1023,174,0.9633

I've been an RD for 4 years, working at an outpatient and IOP level at an ED treatment center and have been looking at next steps.

To be honest, I'd love to just work for a practice/treatment center as an outpatient RD so someone else can handle all the business/finances/marketing and focus on the counseling work, but don't see those hiring often. 

I hate using social media (aside from Reddit lol) and the idea of putting my picture and myself ""out there"" is enough to make me not want to do private practice at all. It also feels so saturated and pointless to have another IE Insta.

This might be a long shot..I have a case of glucerna that expired 1-2 months ago and I was wondering if anyone has any insight as to if it's still safe?

0,"New RD - Need Career Advice Job hunting during a pandemic has not been easy, especially in my field and hometown where it is very competitive with few jobs. I spent a good 3 months searching/applying for jobs only to have either not heard anything back or be rejected due to having ""no experience"" (I am fresh out of college). Last week, I finally got a job offer from a company that pays well for entry level and has decent benefits, the only downside is that I would have to move to an area with an extremely high cost of living. I calculated a bunch of apartments on the market to gauge how much I would be spending if I moved. If I want a decent and safe place, I would only be saving a little under 2K every month. The more affordable areas are in areas that are not as safe, however, I would be saving a little more than 2K a month but there are obviously risks. Regardless of where I decide to stay, I will be paying at least 1.5K-2K a month for an average/older place which I am not thrilled about. 

My field puts a lot of emphasis on experience and having even 6 months of experience on your resume can make a huge difference on whether or not you get an interview. My only motivation for taking this job at this point is to get that experience and leave after 1 year (maybe less). I'm just not positive if this is the right decision for me. The way I look at it, I have two options: I either turn it down and risk having no job for the next 3-6 months (this is an *assumption*, but looking at how long it took me to get ONE interview and offer I would say this is definitely a possibility) with hopes that some how I land a job here **OR** I take this job and barely get by (again, will only save a little less than 2K every month after rent, food, gas, etc.), however it allows me to gain experience and may help open doors for jobs back home where I am from and have family. 

I guess I just need advice or even just personal stories on what others did in this situation. Did anyone else make a sacrifice (such as paying high rent, being alone in a new area with no friends or family, barely being able to save up money while working due to high cost of living) to gain experience in their field and for their future? How did it work out for you? I think my indecisiveness comes from the possibility of NOT finding a job in my hometown if I do turn this one down. Especially during a pandemic where people aren't hiring as much, few jobs to begin with, and a large market of people with more experience.

0,"Managing diabetes and nursing staff in LTC Sorry I’m advance for any mistakes I am writing this at work.

I am a new dietitian in LTC and while we do have therapeutic diets some of my carb control residents are super picky and get select menus but only want carb based foods. As far as I understand state laws are that residents can make their own choices, if they refuse a carb control diet they can do so. It’s is my job to educate them on their choices. 

Today I was going through a menu with a picky DM resident who literally will not eat meat because he’s on mechanical soft. Hates it ground. The nurse came into the room and started talking about DM residents and how their blood sugar are high because of all the carbs we give them. She’s kinda a problem nurse around here when it comes to DM residents. 

My question is how do you manage diabetics in LTC who refuse a carb control diet? How do you handle the nursing staff trying to take food and juice away from them? Should we not just be managing their DM with medication?",1034,195,-0.9022

Question: In what ways can I help prepare myself for becoming an RD? 

I'm currently working on my associates, still working on knocking out my gen ed. It will take me until at least mid 22 to graduate. I thought in the meantime it would be good to start working on chemistry little by little because I know that it will be a problem area for me. What things can you think of that I can start working on now to make things easier for myself later? Math is a big problem area for me, which I know in turn will make science more difficult.

What did you struggle with? What are your regrets? Is there something I can learn from your experience? 

 My dad has suggested that I learn the entire periodic table of elements because in school he was not able to look at a chart and didn't do well on some of the tests because he didn't take the time to memorize all of them. I think that is one of the places I will start unless someone has some more recent information on that.

0,"Toxic, unprofessional boss/ Advice for applying and interviewing for new jobs? I've been at my first RD job for a few months. I'm currently the only ""full-time"" clinical dietitian at my hospital and my manager has made it clear over the last few months that she is an unprofessional/ toxic person. Examples: We have a shared office and she leaves her door open and talks negatively about other people in the department or other hospitals (she will often call people by derogatory names like bitch, asshole, and she will go on and on complaining for hours). It stresses me out and I don't want to shut my door because she's made comments about that as well (Oh, am I talking to loud? Am I bothering you? etc). She has made rude/ accusatory comments to me on several occasions. She seems as if she likes to assume the worst of people but she really does not know me and has made no attempts to ask me how I'm doing since I started here. She will even straight-up ignore me (says hello and goodbye to everyone else except for me, just really bizarre behavior). I told her I had a maintenance emergency in my apartment and that I could either work from home or I'd have to take off work so I could have a plumber come over and she directly accused me of lying. I was appalled. 

I have overheard her complain to other people that she can't assess my work because she isn't ""technically qualified"" as she says (she is a CDM) so I am wondering if her behavior comes from a place of insecurity/ ego.. not that I care so much about the motivation behind her behavior, but my point is that I don't think it's a personality conflict as much as it's that she feels she has something to prove by treating me badly (if that makes sense?).  The majority of the very few interactions I've had with her - and trust me, I try to limit them - have been negative despite my best efforts to be polite and professional. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt because I don't like to judge people based off first impressions, but after a few months I'm convinced she has some kind of cluster B personality disorder or something. I really feel like I have a high school bully for a boss... and I have no plans to complain or approach her about it, as she has been in the position for about 10 years and I know it won't do any good.

So I'm dealing with her behavior as best I can (mostly dismissing her lack of professionalism and trying to focus on my work and gaining valuable clinical experience in my limited time at this hospital), but I'm worried about applying to jobs without a manger reference after this (I will definitely NOT use her, but maybe another PRN dietitian I work with 1 day a week). I'm PRN covering for the full-time dietitian right now while she is on medical leave, so this isn't a permanent thing at least.... I just worry that this is just going to look terrible to potential employers. She obviously can't speak to my work performance due to her lack of qualifications and I'm sure she would talk negatively about me to any potential employer after hearing the way she talks about other people. Have you been in a similar situation as an RD? I could really use some advice as far as how I can phrase questions about my work environment during future interviews, avoid sounding negative, etc. I worked with many clinical dietitians and clinical managers in my internship that were ALL wonderful so I know this isn't the norm, I'm just frustrated and having anxiety mainly about applying to other clinical jobs after this.

\- I've read that starting 2024 you will have to have a masters to take the CDR. Does that mean I will need to pick an accredited school that offers a masters?

I am very interested in pursuing a career as a dietician but I want to hear some personal experiences: the good and the bad. I want to know the pros and the cons - every little detail. Here are some additional questions I have as well:

- According to Google, the average pay is around $60,000. If you feel comfortable sharing, is this true for you? I know this is an opinion based follow up question but do you believe the average pay increase since they will be requiring a Masters after 2024?

- Did you struggle getting a job. Please explain if so And do you feel as though the demand will increase or decrease? Have you worked at multiple different locations I.e. hospitals, private practices etc.

- Are most RD’s employed by hospitals? I know there are other employers but I’ve only been able to find information on RD’s who are employed by hospitals. If you do not work for a hospital, would you mind sharing where you work and what your day to day experience is? Good and bad please.

- I see a lot of posts about nurses and doctors not taking RD’s seriously. Is this true for you? Do you feel as though you are not taken seriously by your peers? Is there a field I could minor in or maybe double major in that would coincide with Dietetics that would better prepare me and help others to take me seriously?

- what does your work schedule look like? I’m interested if an RD, who work in a hospital, has more of a nurses schedule that’s all over the place or if they have set hours. I’m also interested in the schedules of those who do not work at a hospital.

- is it worth it? It’s expensive and a decent amount of school especially since I will have to get a Masters. I just want to make sure I’m making a sound decision.

Please share the aspects you love and hate! If you could prepare a future Dietician for anything what would it be? What do you wish you knew before hand? 

I want the most in-depth account of your experience or as much as you are comfortable sharing. I appreciate any assistance.",2056,377,0.998

Thought it could be an option to just get an essential amino acid powder. 
Since I can’t store or prepare fresh foods I won’t be able to have my usual egg yolks which I basically live of. Also butter won’t be practical, and since I can’t have plant oils (which would be easy to store at room temp) I’ll lack a fat source.

_My question: does it negatively affect bioavailability of amino acids if they are consumed only by themselves?_

Backstory: 

I was offered a job (32-hr inpatient) a few weeks before the end of my internship but with the understanding I couldn't start for a few weeks due to family medical issues that they happily worked with. I have now been at the job for less than a month when I was recently approached via LI about a job opening at a private practice in the area with a focus that I'm highly interested in. They are currently telehealth for the foreseeable future (like so many) and have offered me 20-hr/wk to work with my current job although they would prefer F/T. Not to mention the pay is higher and would allow me to be home with my kids who are also still 100% virtual for school.  Financially it's not a huge factor for me as I am blessed to be working for self-fulfillment vs need. 

So...what would you do? Would you leave the current employer in the lurch? Suck it up for a few months doing both (and working WAY more hours than I had intended with a large family at home)?

0,"College Student- Need Advice! Hey everyone. I’m a second-year undergrad biology student at a NON-accredited college in California who will be graduating in 2022 (3 years). I was all for being a pre-med until I realized I didn’t want to go to med school. I’m really confused by all the information out there because I feel like my position is unique (still haven’t graduated yet, in the middle of my college career). My school does not offer a nutrition degree nor is it accredited by ACEND. 

Can anyone advise me on what I should do in the near future? Ideally, I want to complete my bio degree and not have to switch undergrad schools. I also want to minimize the time and money I spend in between graduating college and getting a masters/internship. Any insight on what specific pre-reqs your masters programs require?

0,"Newborn nutrition requirements **Warning - story of child neglect below, don't read this if you are easily upset!**

I came across a story about a five-month-old baby girl in Russia who was kept in a duffle bag for months by her mother, who was apparently ""hoping"" she would starve to death :(

She was kept alive by her brother, who sporadically fed her food through a syringe as well as baby biscuits dipped in milk.

I am wondering if this poor baby will grow up okay given that she was not given the correct nutrients for the first five months of her life.

In school, I remember learning a lot about the nutrients required at different stages of pregnancy, but we only really learn that babies should be exclusively breast/formula fed for the first 6 months of life. I know that if a pregnant woman doesn't consume enough folic acid, the baby is at risk of spina bifida, but what happens if a baby has been given barely any food for her first six months?? What sort of psychological and physical consequences would that have in the long run? 

Babies are so fragile and can die for no reason at all. There are so many dos and don'ts when it comes to feeding a baby, and many adults find it difficult, so I am amazed that a 12-year-old boy was able to keep her alive.

0,"Left the RD world First off, I apologize in advance for this lengthy post. Feel free to scroll past if this doesn’t resonate with you. Things have been extremely emotionally difficult for me the past two months and I need an outlet. 

I made a post a few weeks ago about my DI experience and the severe depression and anxiety I was spiraling into because of how much I hated the program I was in. It manifested into physical symptoms - sleepless nights, barely eating 500 cals/day, thoughts of not wanting to be alive so I didn’t have to experience another day as an intern, hair loss, rash outbreaks, and weeping sessions and breakdowns at the internship site. I had a therapist and even that wasn’t helping enough. He suggested that I leave the program to which I responded in complete shock, convinced that that was NOT a viable option or even an option period. But he made a statement that truly opened my eyes - if I stuck around and pushed myself beyond the limits of what I wanted, I would’ve been a train wreck by the end of it all and god knows how long it would take me to recover from the trauma. 

Over the years, I grew a huge aversion for this field due to the suffering I had to endure to get to the internship and the genuine disinterest I had when nutrition-related topics were brought up and that feeling of my heart dropping to my stomach if anyone asked me a nutrition question. Honestly, I only pushed myself to pursue this pathway because throughout the entire education process, the RD path and the traditional roles were heavily pushed upon us and anything that was less than or non-RD, seemed to be frowned upon.I had no intentions of utilizing the credentials once I passed the exam. I simply wanted the credentials just to have them and was contemplating day in and day out whether it was even worth it to put myself through that just to have something I wouldn’t use.

Well, fast forward to present day. I withdrew from the program because I felt it drove me over the edge. I’m still sulking in guilt at the fact I took a spot from someone who really wanted it and all the money and time that was invested to get to this point. I feel like this will haunt me for the rest of my life. I’m not sure where to go from here or how to cope with these terrible thoughts. I like talking about food. I’m passionate about sustainability and farms/gardening, and getting in touch with nature. I care about where my food comes from and how it affects people, society, and the environment.

The bright side is I was just able to land a non-RD job at a nonprofit organization helping refugees and immigrants acclimate to America and one of their larger programs partners with local retailers to provide them with nutritious meals. So in a way, I am definitely still utilizing my knowledge from school and I know this will be so rewarding. I’m also considering transitioning into a business career within the natural food sector and can’t help but feel like having the RD would be an asset. However, the thought of having to go through an internship program again actually makes me sick.

Obligatory post letting you all know another dietitian has joined the fold. I passed my exam this morning on my first try with a 30! 

I passively studied using the prep app for about 2 weeks, and then buckled down and went through the prep app again, and then once through the 2017 Inman over the span of another 2 weeks. I completed about 75% of the practice questions in Inman, but really wasn't fond of them. The prep app is great as it explains the answers, whereas Inman had me scratching my head a lot of times. 

I had intense anxiety leading up to it and 100% thought I had failed. It was very difficult and honestly I felt like I was guessing on many questions. I forced myself not to get locked up in a decision and overthink. Paralysis by over-analysis. Know yourself and what studying habits work. There's more than enough recommendations on how to study. There are people who need a week and will pass, and those who need multiple months. Don't compare yourself! You finished the degree, you finished the internship, you WILL pass the exam!

I'm graduating this semester with a Foods and community Nutrition major with a Health education minor. Looking back it really doesn't sit well with me that I sold myself short and took a major that only required the core requirements from the original dietetic major. I want to graduate and find a job in the nutrition field, or maybe as a personal trainer. I'm kind of lost and have no real guide on how or what to do after college. I kind of just pick this major just to pick a nutrition major since my college was paid for by FAFSA. If I ever want to go back, FAFSA is not going to pay anything since I'm going to receive a bachelor's.

(I thought of maybe failing one of my classes (credit/no credit)  so I won't graduate so I can come back and switch my major again to dietetics and go at it again so FAFSA can help me but I don’t know. I'll talk to my advisor about that.

Looking into it i also noticed that besides being an RD, which i can't do atm obviously, what else is there? I feel like I'm over qualified to be a personal trainer but I'm underqualified as an RD. I also don't know how to get a personal trainer certification so I'll have to look into that.

0,"DI program, backup plan, and depression TLDR: I’m taking a gap year at WIC, IF I even get the job, and applying to DI programs next year. I might get my CNA at this time and apply for nursing programs too as a backup plan. What do y’all think? Sorry this post is long.

Hi everyone. I know this has been all over this sub, but I felt like I had to post it. I just graduated with my bachelors. I applied for internships, but didn’t match. I am now finding out this degree is useless without being an RD. I really regret getting this degree. It was always encouraged to work with WIC and SNAP and other areas if you didn’t get matched. There are no jobs like that in my area right now, so I am applying to WIC jobs a few hours away. I took my DTR exam, but failed by one point. Even then, there is only a few DTR jobs in my area and they are all part time and pay crap. I don’t have money for a masters, and it doesn’t seem like there are any useful masters degrees that allow my bachelors. I had a hard time in school with depression and anxiety and I feel so hurt and cheated by everyone and everything. I feel like my DPD program was not upfront about costs, internships, DICAS, everything. This is the worst my depression and anxiety has ever been. I started taking medication again, but it’s only been a couple a days so I guess I’m still waiting for it to work. All I have done is cry for the last couple of days. I feel like everyone around me is doing great and here I am with this useless degree. My plan is to work with WIC for a year, save money up for an internship and apply again. I also might get my CNA and apply for nursing school and get an associates in that as a backup. What worries me is how competitive nursing schools are😕I don’t think my grades are too bad, but their not too good. Also nervous about the teas test, but I would get a tutor for that. Nervous about the classes too. It looks like a WIC nutritionist pays around 30,000-40,000?  And an associates in nursing starts out at 40,000 but as a dietitian I would start out at around 50,000-58,000. So would it even be worth it’s for nursing? I think my depression has made me feel lost and not sure of what I want to do. I’ve always imagined myself in a decent apartment and decent pay. I don’t have to have luxury, but I want to be able to support myself and have some extra money If I need it. I’ve always been interested in nursing, but never tried it due to my anxiety. All I ever wanted was to get a decent paying job and move out of my parents house, but I feel like every decision I have made has made me stay here longer. At times I wonder if I would be kicked out of a DI or nursing program because of the difficulty. I feel stuck.",2719,538,-0.9927

I have yet to meet a patient that agreed right away to having a feeding tube placed. Many patients suffer a lot of weight loss and other side effects related to poor nutrition before agreeing to tube feeding.


One clinic I service has moved toward placing feeding tubes prophylactically for certain head/neck patients. These patients have done really well during treatment. I think having multiple disciplines supporting TF at the beginning is helpful. I have also found that many patients think TF is all-or-nothing. Explaining that they can continue to eat and drink orally (if safe to do so) with a feeding tube seems to help.

I've always struggled with anxiety and depression even with medication, but also focus, boredom, decisions, and memory and I've come to the realization recently that I may have ADHD.

Aside from the irony that I'm only realizing this as I'm finishing my degree, I'm also grappling with the decision of what to do next. I know I want to get testing and therapy (just in general), but I'm wondering if it's even appropriate for me to be starting a DI when balancing my mental health is already a full-time job and there's a possibility of starting new medications. And medication will have to be changed and adjusted, maybe not even just ones for ADHD but my anxiety and depression ones too. When I started anxiety meds for the first time I was an absolute trainwreck while they took time to kick in and again 6 months later when I needed a new prescription.

If I get a match, I will be moving hundreds or thousands of miles from where I am now, from family and home, and my long term boyfriend so I'll be isolated from my support system.

I’m from Central America and I’m a Dietetics student about to finish my degree. I did my clinical internship at the most important hospital of the country. My family is planning to move to the US and maybe just maybe I will also move to study my MSc in the US or Canada. 

I always tried to get information from the Academy, ASPEN, ESPEN, FELANPE, etc. to do our job at the hospital. Can you imagine there’s not even a protocol on what in the world we must do in hospitals once we get to our internship? I was so amazed at this that I couldn’t believe I did 4 years of university education to end up in a place where NOBODY had an idea why I was there. 

So, I’ve always been very passionate about everything I do. I can’t handle things that are done poorly. So I designed a proposal on what a Dietetics student must do and accomplish on their internship at least on the hospital we were working on. Yes, it’s THAT badddd! A student doing the job of an adult. 

I tried to standardized everything I could and propose work protocols. And i tried to gather as much evidence I could to inform what was our role, why we do what we do and how we could accomplish that in our hospital. 

Did you know there is not ONE SINGLE dietitian working inpatient on the most important hospital of the country?! There is SO MUCH need that I wish I could do more but it is so overwhelming. 

SO, going back to my question and after giving you guys a bit of my background and why my internship was so frustrating but so enriching at the same time, do you guys from rich countries also do enteral calculations? 😹 what I mean is this: 

So we have available basic enteral formulas. We DO NOT have special formulas. We do calculations of nutrition requirements and “modulate” feedings depending on what we need. We use powdered milk, cornstarch, Karo syrup, coconut oil, Proteinex powder, and other ingredients to modulate the diets. 

When I go to Abott’s webpage for example, i see so many options we don’t ever have available here. What if you need an isocaloric diet, you must modulate it. If you want it high protein, you must add it. If you want it lower carbohydrates, you must modulate it, and so on and so on. 

We must experiment with the formulas available and different ingredients to achieve what the patient needs. So I was wondering if this is something done only here or is it actually a normal thing to do in Dietetics no matter where you are? 

We have so many needs in the hospital I tend to think we are the only ones that have to deal with this and probably we’re not the only ones 😟",2799,520,0.8378

1. **You CAN be selected for a random audit on your very 1st cycle**. So start organizing early! I regretted how lax I'd been on this. From now on, I will scan any paper certificates of completion in and keep them all organized in a folder for easy uploading should I get audited again. Just tossing them in a folder doesn't count as organized!
2. ""CDR has begun sending audit notices when the minimum number of required CPEUs and an ethics activity have been logged."" &lt;&lt;- Reminder that i**t's best to log your CEU's as you get them instead of waiting to input them all at the end**. That way, when you reach this requirement, you will get notified if you are selected for an audit early! For example, my cycle doesn't end until May 2023, but since I input all my CEU's so early, I could have taken 3 years to submit my audit paperwork! 
3. The older RD's I worked with assumed that the more CEU's you log, the less likely you'd get picked for an audit. They also assumed that you could not be selected for an audit BEFORE submitting your log for approval. Not true! See #2 for audit selection. 
4. I had 5 CEUs denied for very stupid reasons that I didn't think were ""my problem"". For example, I did some webinars with [Eatrightcpe.org](https://Eatrightcpe.org). The certificate of completion they generated at the end was uneditable  and missing information. I shrugged this off because since it's the academy who does the audits and the academy who I bought the CEUs from, shouldn't they know this info? Or at the very least, trust what I input into my log correctly or hell even double check it with theirs? Nope! Because *they* didn't fill it out right (ex. wrong amount of CEUs, no completion date, etc), I was denied credit for them. **SO, make sure if there is something wrong with your certificate of completion you have the provider correct it and get you a new one.** 

Overall this was a very simple process and while at first notice was overwhelming, turned out to be just fine. Just start organizing now and don't panic if you get selected!",2333,420,-0.929

The problem I'm facing is that I don't know where to find the right information.

0,"Advice for RD Feeling Incompetent Hello,

This is my first Reddit post ever, but I am looking for advice. 

I have been a dietitian for a little over a year now. I completed my internship and masters program last year (coordinated program).

Throughout the internship, I felt very incompetent and less knowledgeable than the other co-interns. Mind you, this internship was actual hell... We were in graduate school full time, working full time hours at the internship, and doing \~20hours of additional work per week for the internship outside of the workdays. Additionally, many of the preceptors did not like being preceptors and were some of the meanest people that I have ever encountered. 

Fast forward a year. I have a been a consultant RD working in LTC/sub-acute rehab and have gone to over 30 facilities in this time frame. I am a little more confident, but I still struggle with social anxiety, MNT recall, and feel like I am terrible at nutrition education, counseling, and building rapport with patients and other staff members. I also am worried that I am missing important interventions, etc., when it comes to the clinical aspect of things. Note, I am normally the only RD working at these facilities, completely responsible for managing my workload, and unable to ask more seasoned RDs for help or advice. 

When I talk to my other co-interns now, they are all very confident and feel competent as RDs. 

Is this normal? I feel that I should be more confident in my ability as a practitioner at this point. 

I'd love advice on how other RDs built their confidence, competence, and clinical/education/counseling skills.

She is 34, overweight, doesn´t have diabetes nor hypertension, and was diagnosed with depression more than 10 years ago. She started medication the first time she went to the Dr. which helped her manage her depression in the short term but made her gain 40 lb. This made her lose hope on anti-depression treatments, being this the main reason why she left the treatment and stopped seeing her Dr. After gaining weight it has been almost impossible for her to lose weight until she came with me and was able to lose her first pounds, -1% body fat and no muscle loss two weeks after our first session. 

It has been many years since she hadn´t visited a Dr, so she did saw a Psychiatrist last week that prescribed her Wellbutrin (Bupropion) 75 mg once per day and Clonazepam 1 mg once per day. The Dr told her she would experience less appetite and by her second week (this is this week) she is in fact experiencing less appetite. 

Our plan before visiting the Dr. was: 
1. 150 g CHO first week to learn carbohydrate counting, 130 g second week, 100 g third week, 100 g fourth week
2. 75 g of CHO after first month of decreasing carbs intake in 3 meals a day, 
3. Protein in each meal, 
4. Fats (specific sources) in each meal, 
5. Increase fat intake if she was feeling like having snacks between meals 
6. Vegetables as much as she wanted
7. Saturdays and Sundays she and her husband would not cook and they usually order food. She was ""aware"" of her carb sources and that helped her make better decisions when ordering food. I felt like this would help her see food with more ""freedom"" as she had had bad experiences with food before.

I’ve been trying to make her understand she doesn’t need to be skinny to be healthy. But the weight “issue” is hugely important for her. She states part of her depression comes from multiple factors, of course, but her weight is definitely one. Besides focusing on weight, I also like to focus on multiple nutrition education sessions. 

Now that she´s on her medical treatment:
1. Is there any specific nutrition information I need to know regarding this medication? 
2. Is there information with low carb eating and Bupropion?
3. Does anyone has had experience with this medication and low carb nutrition therapy before? 
4. Do you think keeping the 75 g CHO goal per day is still suitable?
5. Are there specific steps you would take from this point to generate good results and/or optimize nutrition?

She previously did this periodically, but now it seems like that’s all she does during the week

It seems like every other week she is emailing me with small edits, which I honestly don’t agree with and it’s been getting to me. It’s lowering my confidence and moral to keep advocating for my work. Not to mention she does this for the other RDs as well. I can’t imagine how much time it takes her to review, audit and dive back into each patients medical chart to find things she is commenting on. 

I’m just wondering if this is normal? Relative to the ratio of patients I see she is auditing more than half. How does she have time to do this? Is this a normal occurrence? I’ve never that this happen (audits happened rarely, never this much) at my other full time clinical roles and feel like she’s micromanaging us. I might be taking this too personally but I sometimes feel like her comments are rude - like she can’t trust her clinical team, especially when she emails me about a audit when I’m not working and calls me off shift!

0,"Nutritionist working at WIC: Advice Hi all - Was hoping to get possible advice on how to approach a rapidly deteriorating situation at my current place of work:

I’m a male military veteran who used my GI Bill to go back to school for a B.S. in health sciences - What I saw as a “stepping stone” degree to higher education in the healthcare field. I’m currently working in the WIC program which is a little outside of what I was looking for, but is not bad as my first job out of college. The only problem is, all of my coworkers and teammates at WIC are women - No problem with this, but I just feel completely ostracized and out of place at work everyday although I’ve tried to the best of my ability to be social and friendly with everyone. And because of the rampant gossip I hear about other coworkers behind their backs, I know that I’m being gossiped about &amp; talked about behind my back as well. Furthermore, I’ve done the best I can at this job with the tools and knowledge I’ve been given but there has been little to no job training done outside of computer-based powerpoint training and it seems that you’re not appreciated for what you do correct and do well, but heavily chastised when you make a mistake - Many times on things I’ve never been taught in the first place. 

Alongside this, it seems that my boss is playing favoritism with a new girl that was hired a few months after me - Praising her, giving her a position above me as community outreach coordinator and internship coordinator in front of me (idk if this was to try and motivate me or maybe demean me in some way..??) The new girl was even given her employee orientation before me - To date, I’ve worked for WIC for 5 months now and never received a proper employee orientation. I just can’t hell but feel that everyone else is being held to a different set of standards and rules than I am. It’s making me absolutely miserable at work all day every day - sick to my stomach most days. Sunday nights are the worst and I begin getting anxious, depressed and nauseous. Just today (9/21/20) I was running a little behind and came in at the same time as new girl, nobody said anything to new girl but I was asked for a reason as to why I was late this morning and before leaving for home at the end of the night, my boss said she had to do a review with me tomorrow (I’m assuming it will be pertaining to my being late this morning). 

Sorry for the long post, was just hoping somebody could offer some insight or advice to my situation. Anything is appreciated - Positive, negative, etc. 

TL;DR: Male working at WIC, completely out of place and miserable due to lack of communication, training, gossip and favoritism to the point of being nauseous at work everyday, wondering what my options are for other jobs requiring a bachelor’s in the healthcare field.",2840,524,-0.9636
0,"I’m DONE I can’t do this anymore. 😡😪😤

No matter what I do, it’s not good enough for employers. Here’s a timeline of my nutrition/dietetics career since graduating a few years back. 

-Diet Tech at rehab/LTC for about 2 years
-Distance DI (ISPP)-couldn’t find preceptors to cover some rotations and found it unsupportive on many levels-dismissed from internship. Got in way of my work. Was devastated, but over it now.
-Diet Tech at rehab hospital for almost 2 months-let go for not improving numbers (menus collected) when  there was no structure in place, making it nearly impossible to do this efficiently and get all my work done on time. My coworkers took shortcuts just to get out on time. 

~Didn’t work for a bit because of the madness that occurred while interviewing for new DTR jobs.~

-Diet Tech/Consultant in LTC facilities-Dismissed less than a week ago after 1 week for not completing enough assessments. Yes, 1 week. I moved across the country for this position. I didn’t even get the time to prove myself. Was working remotely on PCC, learning and applying my company’s charting standards, learning the policies of the facilities I was assigned to and taking on more high risk patients all at once. I never met these residents and hadn’t stepped foot in the facilities. Despite these limitations, I just wanted to do a good job and I have done this before.

to have a high calorie, high protein diet and to have 5-6 small meals throughout the day to decrease feelings of fatigue. For nutrition counseling, I recommend the patient to have education on meal prepping so when it comes to meal times, the patient is not too tired to eat.

0,"Passed RD Exam! + Tips! Hey everyone!

Super happy to say that I have passed my RD exam today! Exactly 45 days ago I sat for my first attempt at the exam and unfortunately failed. I was extremely upset and down on myself. All this hard work to get to this spot and to fail at one little test? Well I'm here to tell you what changes I made in my studying habits that helped improve my score enough to pass and general test taking tips.

Firstly, I purchased the 2020 Inman review. This was the most helpful resource for me personally to learn all of the content on the exam. I went through once domain by domain listening to the audio and highlighting the info wherever she said 'note'. Then I would read each section by myself out loud to help the information sink in better. After going through one of the domains, I would take the practice questions associated with it. I would self-grade myself and note the pages where I could find the answer to those questions. Now let me tell you, this took FOREVER, but was super helpful in my studying process.

I also made note cards on particular topics that I thought I would need a little extra attention/memorization. I did these for the diabetic exchanges/food borne illness/ and governmental programs. I would flip through these everyday and by the end, I knew them all.

Another resource that I used heavily was MedicalPrep (previously called PocketPrep). I bought the one month subscription that gave you access to 650 questions. I went through all of the questions after I took a deep dive in Inman. What I loved about this app was the explanations. Not only would it tell you the correct answer, but it would explain why none of the other options are correct. This helped me reason with each question to make sure I was choosing the 'best' answer. I also found that this app had questions and answers most closely sounding to the actual exam from what I remembered the first time around.

A huge struggle for me for the first exam was answering the subjective type questions. If it is related to content/knowledge at least that is something I can memorize. With the subjective, you have to use your critical thinking skills to choose the BEST answer. Note that all of the answers are feasible, but they range from okay to good to better to best. What I did to tackle my weakness here was Kimberly Kramer's One and Done situational class. Here she taught a method to help break the question down to determine the best answer. I won't get into the specifics as this is her credibility, but I can assure you it was amazing. This honestly helped me greatly because now at least I wasn't taking a shot in the dark, but taking an educated guess. (FYI: she also offers a ton of other classes for every domain and helps teach mnemonics for the info to stick).

Now that I've done all the prep, its time for exam day. Before starting the exam, I wrote my name at the top of my whiteboard, followed by 'RD'. Seeing is believing people. This time around I found the exam to be a lot more straight-forward. Was that because my questions were more simple or because I now knew the information better? Maybe a combination of both. This time I really took my time with the questions. I would write key words for each question on the white board to slow myself down and process what was really being asked of me. All of the effort proved successful when I submitted my last question, filled out the survey and saw 'congratulations' appear on the screen. I can't tell you the wave of relief that flushed over me.

I hope that this is something that you all can use as motivation and advice as you embark on your RD exam. I found this subreddit to be really helpful in my study time so hopefully I can pay it forward now.

Thank you all so much,

Sincerely a newly minted RD

0,"first rd job advice needed Hi everyone I need some advice.

I recently finished an internship back in June and took some summer classes at a local university to finish up my masters degree. I began applying for jobs around July/August. I had an interview in a city about 500 miles from my home. They flew me out there for the interview and paid for my place to stay. I was really nervous about it but it went well. I came home and had another interview at a local hospital. A few days later was called about the job I had interviewed away from home and I ended up accepting the offer.

The job is a multi-site position as a clinical dietitian in long term and acute care. I did have some experience in my internship in acute care but it was minimal. I already scheduled to take my RD exam in October after I move because moving and packing has been a bit stressful and it was hard for me to study at home while so much is going on.

All being said, I am SO excited to finally have my dream job but I want to prepare myself for acute and long term care environments. What kinds of things should I brush up on in terms of nutrition knowledge? Does anybody have any advice for how to prepare walking into my first job and things I should know? What did you find was helpful for you when you first started?

I appreciate any feedback or advice! Thank you so much!",1359,258,0.9866

I have a resident at my facility who is morbidly obese, who came here for rehab to use a walker again after a fall. This information is important to remember.

Her family decided a few months in that they wanted her to be long term, and she was taken off of rehab, essentially keeping her mostly wheelchair bound. She continued to gain some weight, but not much considering the circumstances. 

Recently the owner of our facility has come back and decided to actually run the place instead of just own it, and he's seems to have it out for this resident. He usually refers to her by her weight, and since she's come back from a recent hospital visit he constantly mentions her exact weight since it was taken upon readmission. Today she fell trying to transfer herself from her wheelchair to her bed, and the education intervention that our owner suggested was telling her that she can't transfer herself because she's xxx pounds. Not because she has obesity, but because of weakness to her legs, but because of her exact weight. He and the DON treat her weight as a severe disability although she is currently weight bearing on both legs and was walking with a walker prior to initial admission. 

How do I address the blatant disrespect of this resident and explain patient centered care to these people? I'm afraid that she won't get the care she needs because no one will see beyond her weight.",1573,284,0.5433

1. Complete application for licensure and pay fee
After that is where I am not sure. Do I really have to do the next steps
2. Form 2 Certificate of professional education (my undergrad in nutrition?) get someone from my university to complete this form. No transcript needed as was accredited program 
3. Form 3e exam results- get cdr to fill this out?
4. Form 4c report of planned work experience- get someone from internship to fill this out?

In short- I hate my current job responsibilities (I work in a public health nutrition setting). I find them unchallenging and it is seriously killing my motivation.

My workplace also has an efficiency and organization problem that makes simple things so frustrating to get through. Mildly productive 2+ hour long meetings are the norm because my supervisor won't make agendas (I've asked several times).  In meetings, I've sat back and listened as my supervisor and coworker argued for 30+ minutes about what portion size of vegetables to approve for menus- twice. I was technically never actually trained on how to do my job- just given about 20 documents to read through. My boss frequently stated that ""before going virtual, we would usually show you how to do this in person"". Why not just show me virtually??

I have one foot out the door and I just started 4 months ago.

New ideas that I suggest get sent to ""I'll think about it"" oblivion. We usually just end up doing what the supervisor wanted to do in the first place. Former employees have told me this was par for the course.

I have plans to further my education (public health research or medicine). My hope was that this job would give me ground level public health experience as well some higher level technical skills, like grant writing and teaching, that would align with future goals. Thus far, it hasn't, but to be fair I have not communicated my goals to my boss.

**So my question is- how do I ask my change adverse boss for different job responsibilities that better align with my future goals?**

Lately, I can’t seem to get out of thinking that I chose the wrong career path - mainly, because I keep remembering all the issues that come with becoming an RD (lack of diversity, financial hardships, AND sponsored by big pharma and fast food chains, constant reinforcement throughout our education that clinical dietetics is superior, low pay, lack of respect - just to name a few).

I've become aware through this sub and elsewhere that the dietetic internship is a big hurdle to get over in the process of becoming an RD - specifically, due to the cost and competitiveness/availability of internships.

Currently, I have not yet been admitted to a dietetics program (I'm working on my last couple of prereqs). If I want to commit to pursuing dietetics, is there any advice you can give me on how to make it through the internship phase of the process? Of course, I don't want to accrue a lot of debt from the internship on top of my debt from tuition. I also don't want to have to move in order to complete the internship, as having to pay rent while interning would immensely complicate things and might not be possible. 

What would I need to do now to be one of the fortunate students who is able to get a local, affordable internship? Any advice in terms of grades, GPA, networking, volunteering, extra-cirriculars (I really don't know what would help)? I live in South Florida, for context.

I'm frustrated because in school I busted my butt and seriously knew my stuff. My tech job did wonders for my MI and other soft skills, so I'm super confident there.

0,"Request for career advice (currently majoring in dietetics) Hi, I'm currently pursuing a BS in dietetics and recently started  considering other health-related career paths. I would really appreciate  some advice on which would be best for me, given the context. My  primary reason for wanting to major in nutrition is that the path  involves gaining a solid understanding of basic science and how the body works. I'm also very interested in how diet can enhance one's health over the long term and prevent disease, and I enjoy gaining knowledge  that I can apply to my own life to live more healthily. At the moment at  least, this is the main motivator for my pursuits, as opposed to being  dead set on becoming a nutrition counselor, for example. As of now and the past few years, I mainly gravitate toward nutrition because I want to understand.

I've read some posts on this sub that suggests going the RD track is often not worth the time, energy, and tuition. Money, while not the only thing that's important to me, is important to me. So is upward  mobility. I'm reconsidering pursuing the RD track because I'm concerned  it wouldn't allow me to earn a high income that can grow over time and  to constantly be learning new things about how the body works and how to  be healthy. I'm aware that there are different things an RD can do with their degree, so maybe I don't need to be concerned about these  particular things. 

I would also rather continue to further my own understanding than coach people on eating better. I think I'm more interested in the nuances of nutrition than educating others about the basics. 

Some of the plans I've been considering are: 1) major in nutrition science (not dietetics) and become a nutrition researcher, 2) major in nutrition science and become a PA, or 3) pursue nursing but focus on  nutrition specifically, if that's possible. I'm also considering just getting the dietetics degree/license just to leave open the option to work as a dietitian in some capacity.

As a side note, I haven't shadowed any of these professions yet. I'm not sure how I could since I'm under the impression doing so would violate a patient's privacy.

I really didn't consider nursing until now, and I'd only pursue it if I  could delve into nutrition later on. I began to consider it and the PA route because the pay and job availability/security are better (from what I've read), and it seems to be a more open-ended career, which could be helpful for me since I'm not set on a specific job right now. However, some of the aspect of nursing  that don't appeal to me are the long hours (I'd rather work a 9 to 5  and I value work-life balance) and the fact that it doesn't seem to involve much prevention of health issues.

I don't yet know much about how I would become a nutrition research scientist, but it appeals to me because it would involve constantly gaining new understandings about how food works in the body (have any RDs or nutrition science majors here gone on to be nutrition researchers, by the way?). 

Being a PA seems more desirable to me than being a nurse in the sense that it seems more low-key and less inconsistent in terms of the hours/work schedule, but I could be  wrong as I've only met PAs in doctors' offices as a patient. 

Which path would you guys advise me to go down?",3333,603,0.9641

I’m currently a senior and I’m 21 years old and I only plan to do the JET program for a year so yeah....

My question is should I do the jet program for a year once I graduate and then do my internship or should I do the internship and then do the jet program for a year? The problem is a lot of people are known to get rejected when they apply for the JET program if they are overqualified, for example if you are a registered nurse, doctor, hold a masters degree, doctorates degree etc etc so I think that applies or if you are a registered dietitian because once I do my internship Im going to take the rd test.....

I’m also a little on the fence about it because it seems the MD already has an idea of the diets she wants to prescribe, including things like low-oxalate,  GAPS, and keto diets, which don’t exactly have the strongest evidence base and I personally don’t believe in prescribing unnecessarily restrictive diets of any kind.

I know this could be really neat opportunity to begin building my skills, but as someone who had been planning to take the more traditional “work in a hospital to gain experience first” route and also with a strong interest in nutrition support and intestinal rehab, I also worry that this isn’t necessarily going to give me the skills I need to move in that direction. Will I still struggle to get a clinical job down the line because I won’t have enough “relevant” experience?

Really interested to hear thoughts from anyone with experience working in integrative medicine or as an employee/consultant for a private practice or anyone who has moved between sectors. Thanks in advance!",1852,312,0.9938

They told me they would be conducting interviews into early-mid this week so by the end of the week. I’m driving myself insane waiting, though! 

Is it normal to hear back about a position 1.5-2 weeks after an interview? If I don’t hear back by the end of this week would it be appropriate to follow up?

0,"Doctor requesting we add high sodium foods to a patient meal tray because of hyponatremia, but I'm questioning the validity of dietary sodium being a therapeutic solution Additional background info, the patient has been refusing all medications and IV fluids so we aren't able to correct their sodium through these routes. But from my review of our scientific literature I'm not finding evidence that increasing dietary sodium improves hyponatremia, when in fact dietary sodium has very little to do with blood sodium levels. In this case, I've already been told the patient excessively consumes fluids which I believe to be the source of the issue, but the team is hesitant to try a fluid restriction as the patient would very likely not follow it. My concern is increasing dietary sodium may just result in fluid retention which could worsen his hyponatremia due to fluid overloading.

Help. Recently I received an offer for a new position and I’m so conflicted about whether to take it. Right, now I work as a CDE in an endo office and I really love the work I do. I get to be on the cutting edge of technology for diabetes management and working directly with 3 endocrinologists. The endos really respect me which has taken a couple years to build up. One of our NPs just resigned so they keep telling me they will be depending on me more now. 

The only issue I have with my job is my current pay, especially now they are sort of expecting me to do the position of a NP and not be paid as one. I was offered 3 dollars more an hour at the other position which is hourly with overtime pay and my current position is salaried. 

 I am also just one of two RDs. It would be nice to work with more RDs as I would feel like I’d gain more knowledge and perspective and the other position has 10 of them. 

The new position would allow a lot of development towards classes and doing outreach in the community but I would be walking away from doing insulin pumps/CGMs. I feel like asking for a raise would be an option but with everything going on it makes my current employer response seem unpredictable.

She is quite large so she already has high baseline requirements and on top of it has cellulitis which isn’t healing well and newly diagnosed metastatic cancer which would push the requirements up even more. 

This is my second referral for this poor lady for the same reason. When I saw her the first time she was already emotional, her whole life people had told her she needed to eat less and lose weight and I was probably the first person ever to tell her she needed to eat more to recover. I assessed her to be inappropriate for weight loss (obviously) and she won’t take any of our supplements so I’ve encouraged her to drink some extra chocolate milk which is the only thing she will take. The second referral I received had on it written “needs management of diet, drawer full of sweets and chocs”. Stuff which I had told her to eat!! I was so frustrated. 

I know what I need to do to fix this situation, I supposed this is more of a rant.

&gt;Looking back I think there were many factors that shaped my previously held stance on nutrition. I believe **my education set me up to be susceptible to a plant-based diet**. I was educated that too much red meat is not good. I was educated to value fruits and vegetables over meat. With this mind set, I was predisposed into believing red meat was bad for me and that the only animal protein (if any) I should eat was chicken and fish. I became further **disgusted by red meat through documentaries and books with a vegan agenda**. Red meat causes climate change, red meat decreases our life expectancy, red meat is morally bad. This pushed me further away from red meat and meat in general. I became more focused on this ideology of health rather than listening to my own body. Without me even realizing it, I began to **shape my identity around a plant-based diet**.

0,"Hey fellow RDs! Has anyone had experience working as an RD at a gym/fitness center? I have payment questions :) Hi all, I’ve been scouring the internet with no luck, so I’m hoping someone here might have a similar experience or some guidance for me!

I currently work at a gym (located in the US) and will be be taking on nutrition clients as well. I mentioned to the owner/boss that a private practice I interned at during my DI accepted insurances so patients didn’t always have to pay out of pocket, and now the boss wants me to make that happen at the gym. I don’t know if it matters, but it’s not a globo-gym, so no chain affiliation!

So, my questions for you are:

1) Is it possible to accept insurance in a gym setting?
2) If so, would I need to create a business in my name and run it as a private practice?

Any guidance is hugely appreciated. Just want to make sure I’m staying compliant and not putting my licensure at risk. Thanks in advance!",955,175,0.9692

Also, I know the internships (and then getting the RD job eventually) are incredibly competitive. I heard on a thread somewhere that you usually need to have some sort of clinical or hospital experience or you may not get an internship. Is this true?

For reference, I have a B.S. in Psychology, a B.A. in Anthropology, 3 years of home care experience working with elderly individuals with disabilities, and 3 years experience working for a medical software company for hospitals, supporting pharmacists. So I have working experience, and one of them was in a corporate setting but I don't know if this would look good or be compatible/related.

I'm assuming that many people become a diet tech first and then eventually an RD if wanting to be in clinical - is this the 'normal' path?

Also, I'm considering starting online courses through Kansas State or Alabama State (both are accredited). Is doing courses online frowned upon in this field? Would you recommend doing some online courses for the B.S. but then doing the last year of it in-person for networking purposes etc?

I'm Male, 22, 178cm, 64kg who is moderately active. I run 2km down to my local park and back 5 days a week and do moderate weight training 4-5 days a week. Other than that I sit at a desk most of the time as that is my job. I'm borderline skinny, but I have stubborn fat around my belly like everyone does. What I'm looking for is to drop that belly fat so I can look more defined and also build muscle mass. I'm not looking to get super ripped, but toned enough to show that I'm in decent shape more than anything. 

I eat pretty much the same thing every day, this is my current diet:

Breakfast: Oats, 1 Banana or 1 Apple (or half of each), Ground Cinnamon and a splash of Full Cream Milk

Lunch: 3 Eggs, 1 Wholemeal Toast spread with 1/4 of an Avocado. 

Dinner: 1 cup of Brown Rice, roughly 70g of Mixed Frozen Vegetables (Peas, Carrots and Corn), 3 Fish Fingers (Birds Eye) and a tablespoon of Sweet Chilli Sauce

Snacks: Can of Tuna, Protein Shake (Vital Strength), maybe some Yoghurt and Fruit or Toast.

Currently this equals to around 6000 Kilojoules, 75g Protein, 140g Carbs, 20g Fibre, 38g Sugar, 42g Fat. This would be fine if I was trying to do a calorie deficit, but not too sure if that's good if I also want to build muscle as there is not a lot of protein. Personally I think I should be focusing more on building mass more than losing weight, but I'm not too sure. I've been doing this meal plan for 1 month, I've dropped 1Kg, and look a little more defined. Can anyone help me on improving this? I know what I'm doing for weight training determines a lot of things, but I'd like to get my diet right first, as I feel that's more important starting off. I'd like to add chicken into this diet too, maybe get a 4th meal out of it. I don't really like to snack as I'd prefer larger meals to feel fuller for longer. Any advice is appreciated.

I’m going to a dietician in 2 weeks and want to prepare as best I can. What questions should I ask? How should I prepare? What resources should I look at?

*background on me*
- epilepsy (diagnoses in Dec 13, it was under control with the help of keto - fat heavy diet, prior to Nov )
- Crohn’s disease (diagnosed in Nov ‘19, moved away from Keto to leaner diet to try manage Crohns naturally. My seizures relapsed, Crohns got worse and now I’m on steroids to try manage the Crohns)
- Mental illnesses (PTSD, NEAD, BPD - none of which are relevant, except the borderline as it caused 10 years of disordered eating and purging / binging behaviours)

Which is super fun. The epilepsy / Crohns combo seems to be the biggest issue as the diet that helps my epilepsy has really negatively impacted my Crohns and the diet that is supposed to help my Crohns, triggers my epilepsy.

0,"Remote, part time, coordinated program MPH/RD? Or should I consider other options i.e. Nutritionist CNS cert? Hello! I feel like this is bit of a stretch but heres to hoping! Is there a program that allows remote part time attendance preferably completing a coordinated program for MPH/RD?

Based on my research part-time enrollment is not mentioned specifically but ""graduate in 2-3 years"". Most coordinated programs seemed to be completed within that time frame. If there is little to no options of finding a program like this, another consideration is looking into an MPH in Nutrition allowing to be certified in CNS. 
My understanding between RD and CNS is still vague but it seems like it will be my best option considering the two main options of enrolling PT and remotely.

I have an undergrad degree in Public Health Science, graduated in 2017. I am currently employed for almost 3 years now,, IT support for clinical studies. I am not able to go to another state to continue my education as I hoped.

0,"Salary: Can we have an open conversation? Hello everyone - 

RD of 4 years this October. The last two years I have practiced as a Lead RD over several states - I was involved in the hiring of RDs in the LTC setting across many states and have see a wide variety of salaries, many of which seemed incredibly low for experienced RDs with their MS. 

For reference - recently changed positions to work as a renal RD and was surprised to learn I would make more than my management position aforementioned. 

I want us all to have an open and honest discuss regarding pay so that new RDs can have realistic expectations and that we all feel comfortable asking for what we’re worth. 

Here’s the low down of some of my jobs and their respective pay (I also have my MS in dietetics): 

$30/hr LTC PRN (KY) brand new RD 
(When I started they paid $26/hr but I found out from other RDs that PRN make more typically so I requested an accurate pay scale of $30/hr and they adjusted it.)

Hospital outpatient/behavioral clinic $28/hr (KY) FT - first job (great benefits package so accepted a lower range than I ideally wanted)

LTC RD - $30/hr (WA) FT

Promoted to Lead RD - $34.25/hr (WA) FT
(When I took the promotion they stuck me at $31/hr while I trained, within 8mo I was practicing at a much higher level and requested a raise to $35 and they countered with $34.25.. I took it.)
 
Newly accepted position: Renal RD - $35.50/hr (WA) FT (they consider me ‘inexperienced’ in renal &lt;to be experienced you have to have worked in a dialysis clinic before&gt; and they would not go higher after I was offered a matched salary and $5000 signing bonus by another company.. still liked this job better so trusted my gut and stuck with it.) 

Anyway, I’m just curious what other people are making and their experiences fighting for better pay. There have been many job offers in between that I’ve had to decline simply because their pay scale was so far off from what I expect RDs to make. A few of the recruiters had mentioned that the RDs in their company as a whole didn’t make what I was requesting so they would not be able to meet my salary needs - have you seen or heard this? 

Hope to hear from many of you!",2203,403,0.9905

0,"5 Ways To Manage Your Diet For Diabetes Since my diagnosis with diabetes at the age of eleven, my own diet has changed dramatically.  I maintain my current healthy weight with a great diet/eating plan. If you do plan on losing more than about a stone in weight then I would visit your doctor for more tips on how to do this without risk.  

I've had diabetes for seven years now, but to tell you that how I maintain weight is perfect would be totally wrong of me.  However, I can advise you to follow my steps because I know what works and what doesn't. Before I really begin I must also say that I have been brought up by great parents who taught me to eat everything, and so I do! If there is something that you don't like, there are loads of other diabetic recipes and ideas that you will eat and appreciate.

I am a university student, and I like to buy fresh and organic produce from where I live. I believe that this is important because it can be the best for your body and contain more nutrients and vitamins than most supermarket produce. I like to source food from my fortnightly farmers market in town, which sells amazing meat and dairy produce and fresh in-season fruit and vegetables. Another important thing to remember is eating fruit and vegetables in their season means that they will taste better as well as doing you good. I have a lot of influence from Western European cuisine (mainly France and Italy) as you will tell, but I do not profess to be a chef, and everything is easy to make and very convenient.

I have read countless diet books and diabetic recipe/diet books, and I came to the conclusion that I think really works. I fused all the good things from the diets (but not from every diet) and sort of put together my own one. I call this my Juvenile Diabetes Healthy Diet!

The ""rules"" that I would lay down are as follows:

0,"Have you ever experienced religious discrimination in the workplace? Mods! If this is not allowed please take it down!

I am a dietetic intern in their food service management rotation. I am thrilled that I am one of the few students who has gotten placed. However, I feel as if I have experienced belief discrimination throughout my course at this site. For reference, I am at a Christian-based hospital and I am non-Christian.

Almost every meeting I have attended, the last five minutes end with a bible verse or follow with a prayer. I cannot help but notice that every computer lock screen has a bible verse on it and every tray sent up to patients also has a bible verse. The water cooler chat here was not how the weather was but was how the Sunday church service was. If anyone is to play music in the office, it was going to be Christian music. 

I feel like I am being disrespectful if I say no to prayer because I simply do not share the same belief. I try to be courteous by putting my head down when they say a prayer. I feel disregarded because the staff (food service director, executive chef, etc.) assumes my religious beliefs. I understand having a chapel in the hospital, so patients and their families can gather there when they may be going through the grieving   process. However, it seems disrespectful to bring this into employee meetings. Not only do I feel uncomfortable throughout this entire supervised practice experience, but I felt like I was being shamed for not practicing Christianity. 

The entire time I felt lost because I did not know who to turn to about this. The Food Service Director and all other team leaders follow this behavior. I sat down with the Food Service Director after one of the meetings where she shares a prayer, and she said to me “I’m so glad I can do this” I replied with “do what?” and she said “share my messages and talk about my religion. I can tell which employees are fond of it and which are not.” I just stood there in silence out of the excruciating discomfort I had experienced. Did she know that I was not one of the staff members that was a non-Christian? What if I had admitted that I feel awkward? I want to emphasize that I have nothing wrong with other religions. I believe everyone has a right to religious freedom and to practice his/her own religion and faith – but to bring it into the workplace felt like a form of religious discrimination. I have volunteered at other hospitals that also have some religious affiliation, but have never experienced this. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Is this normal for a hospital setting? Should I just stay quiet?

0,"The contents of adipocytes? So i'm not a dietician - my specialty is more in cellular and molecular biology. I have an idea for a project, but to avoid any potential adverse events it would be incredibly useful for me to know the contents of adipocytes - i've done some initial research, but I think dieticians would likely have a far more in-depth knowledge of this area than me! 

Because my idea is a therapeutic, and it may drain substances which adipocytes sequester from the body, this information could be incredibly useful in preventing side-effects from my therapeutic. 

So far, I have identified a number of substances that I could monitor and control - the fat-soluble vitamins, iron and copper. Are there any other substances that adipocytes (particularly white adipocytes) sequester that I should be concerned about? Are there any sources I should look at?",870,145,0.6446
0,"Keep my DTR? Hi everyone!

I just finished my DI last week and I’m just waiting to receive my verification statement so I can schedule the CDR RD exam.

I have my DTR and fees are due this month. I’m not using my DTR currently. I had to resign from my position in order to intern at the hospital I had been working in per policy. It was a bummer but for the best, I guess.

I’m looking for the group’s input on if I should let my DTR lapse since I plan to have my RD soon. My DI had a mandatory exit exam that we had to pass to complete the program. It was based on Inman so I pretty much married the Inman study guide for several months. I also did the Eatrightprep study guide and Pocket Prep.

0,Prerequisites to get into MS program? Hi I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post a question like this. It has been really difficult to get an answer out of the colleges I’m interested in and in my experience they rarely ever answer emails about course equivalencies. I guess we are all supposed to figure it out and then apply and screw us if the courses we slaved at don’t fit in. I hope someone can *kindly* answer this question for me. I want to fulfill the prereqs for “general Bio” and “general chem”. One school had a course equivalency sheet for the community college I’m enrolled at but the courses are full. The chem class is a one semester class called “intro to chem”. I asked the chem teacher at the community college if there are other courses that would fulfill the same requirement and he said most nurses and nutrition majors take “college chem I and II”. I am wondering if I would need to take I and II If the MS programs only require a semester. In your experience did you have to take I and II? Would Bio I be significantly different from a one semester course in Intro Bio?,1098,206,0.8173

The questions will involve: why you chose the profession, degree or certificate obtained, what you do, or what your job is on a day-to-day basis, what are tips, tricks, tools, etc. that you use to help motivate clients to eat healthier, achieve healthier body weight, or successfully engage in physical activity, what motivates you to do this type of work, why you believe eating healthier, achieving a healthier body weight, or engaging in physical activity is important, etc.!

If this is you, please comment below or message me and I will send you the questions.

0,"Thoughts on ""Dietitian Side-Hustle Make a 6-Figure Salary Business Coaches""? I've gotten several messages from these kinds of folks in the past. I won't name names because I'm sure others have seen and know what I mean and if I'm just not thinking about this in the right way, I don't want to shame anyone.

I have generally always engaged with them in a friendly way and hear what they have to say or what they think they have to offer me, especially because I have always dreamed of starting my own business, but I just don't know what to think. They make big promises like ""I'll teach you my proven method to turn your salary into 6-figures"" or ""attract 10x the clients overnight!"" or my favorite ""Let me tell you how I made 25k in 1 month even while being a full-time mom"" (all kinds of problematic things with that from my POV). They also seem to trigger my strong emotions a lot with things like: ""are you tired of working in an underpaid clinical job in a basement in the bad part of town?"" and then trying to build really fast trust with ""I used to be just like you, I know exactly how you are feeling"" or ""I never imagine I would have this much success"". 

Anyways, they always loop me in with their sophisticated pitches and beautiful websites/blogs/Instagrams, but then they come out that their program costs $4000-6000 dollars. Sometimes it all feels like a more sophisticated MLM scheme because it seems like it would enrich the coach more than the client. Like you're more likely you would make a 6-figure salary by selling these expensive ""groups/programs/masterclasses"" about how to build a business than you ever would actually building a private practice.

Anyways, just wondering what others thoughts are on this? Do my intuitions seem valid?

0,"Failed RD Exaxm  Hey everyone,

Looking for general advice and/or just to rant. So today I took the RD exam for the first time and failed with a score of 22. My main resource was eatrightprep that I went through entirely two times over. I seriously studied for 2 weeks for about 8 hours each day. I was averaging in the low to high 70s for the practice exams, which I read would be consistent with a passing score on the exam. I also had old Inman audios that I used to supplement eatrightprep.

It's just frustrating because I felt prepared going into the exam only to have the questions seem 100 times more difficult on the screen. They were mostly application-based that had more than one right answer. I read through each question twice over to make sure I understood what was asked of me. Any tips for answering those application-type questions. Content-wise I feel confident, but when its those subjective questions like 'which would be the first step', I got tripped up. I seemed to do pretty okay on those types of questions for eatrightprep, but not so much on the actual exam. Perhaps I was just so stressed.

So to ensure I pass at my second go around, I just bought the updated inman review to allow for more test questions and overall exam day tips. Also does anyone have any advice for how I can continue to review eatrightprep?

Overall it's just upsetting to not pass because I've been working up to this moment for so long. It feels as though getting a job and finally becoming a dietitian keeps getting pushed back. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

So I love nutrition/dietetics however the low pay/lack of respect is making me really discouraged. I understand that the amount of respect you get and your privileges as an RD will largely depend on where you work. However, I have heard from almost every RD that they don’t make much and as someone who made a poor choice in undergrad and is now in a lot of debt, I am nervous about the low pay, especially if I may have to get my masters in the future.

I also understand most of the money is in food service, however I do not think I would enjoy that. I would prefer to work with eating disorder patients or in an outpatient center working with PKU and other metabolic disorders. 

Long story short, has anyone been able to pay off a lot of loans and feel that dietetics has paid enough to do so with relatively low stress and/or what are some high paying dietetic jobs that people have that aren’t in the food service sector.

I have always been obssessed with nutrition, fitness, strength training and seeing as food as the true medicine of life! I also value helping those more vulnerable and spreading education. Being an Optometrist does tick those things as I do help people out with their eyesight, however I haven't enjoyed this job in a long time. I realised I only picked this job to please my parents and because it looked comfortable (9 to 5, social time etc.) but I have no passion/interest for it. Whereas Nutrition is something I read for fun till late hours, whether it be doing courses (which I have done), reading forums, experimenting with myself and my own nutrition/fitness. So I thought why not try something that I enjoy whilst helping those that are more vulnerable than me in this game of life without regretting not ever doing it?

So I am researching this career properly before I make a sure commitment and one question I wanted to ask is: what is a typical patient routine like? Is it a lot of talking/consulting? Or is it a lot of testing? How long does it take to deal with the average patient? If I could get a breakdown of a typical patient routine that would be great. For example as an Optometrist my routine is: 1) Take a case history of symptoms 2) Check the health of their eyes with appropriate equipment 3) check ocular motor skills 4) refract to get a reading of their eyesight. 

I understand that one can be a Dietitian and work in different areas so answers may vary, but relevant all the same to my research!",1683,304,0.9882

0,"Resident on multiple appetite stimulants Question about resident on multiple appetite stimulants. So I have a resident who was started on remeron 7.5mg qd and megace 10ml BID following a sudden cognitive decline where she stopped eating and lost \~20# in 2 weeks. She was also started on zyprexa which can affect appetite and weight. I recommended to add a end date for megace and reassess after 30 days. The 30 day mark is approaching and I'm not sure how to proceed since so many meds were started at the same time. Intake has improved slightly. Before it was 0-25% now about 25-50%.

1. How do you determine if they are elevated because of dehydration or because the patient actually has a renal insufficiency. I would usually look at BUN/Cr ratio. I read that if it’s &gt;20 it’s usually pre renal. 
2. At which point does elevated bun and Cr affect your protein recommendations.

GFR between 30-40 with a stage 3 pressure injury.

How accurate a calorie count should be? 
How can I calculate it quicker so it doesn’t take a lot of time? 
Do I need to address dietary fluids or not? Sometimes it seems that they only had 200 ml from dietary 🤦🏻‍♀️😞
However in reality it’s not 200 ml. 
What about the calorie count come back like : 25% BKF, 40% lunch? How do I know if it’s for entree or other things? 
What if I only got sth like: 30% entree and nothing else was addressed? How do I calculate this? 
I feel like most of the times it’s absolutely inaccurate and waste of time to do a calorie count.

During my dietetic internship, my preceptor at a GI focused outpatient clinic frequently had to ""clear up"" information that was given by the patient's chiropractor. The worst case I saw was a mother of a young child was prepping her son for endoscopy test for Celiac disease. When she told her chiropractor about it, he began telling her all about how it could be because he is eating too many pesticides. Thankfully, she was skeptical and adopted a gluten free diet for her son after the test came back positive. Still, I often think about how damaging that could have been. Had her mom gone with ""Dr."" chiropractor, her son's life could have been filled with much more pain and long-term damage. 

This surprised me enough that I did a bit of digging, chiros have no evidenced based practice requirements, receive minimal education compared to physicians, and are truly only useful in a narrow scope of practice.

It's my first job since I graduated and I haven't had any other experience since. The first ward I was put on was managing eating disorder patients, which I thought was an area that was too complex for a new graduate, but I managed to get through it. I've now been rotated to general medicine where I am covering three wards, since the eating disorder dietitian has returned from leave. 

I had one shift in gem med on Friday before the weekend and managed to get through my caseload, but had to stay back quite late because of new referrals and I needed to set them up for the weekend. I was pretty happy with myself, but I received a call from my manager who gave me some very vague ""feedback"". She was concerned about how I was performing because she had heard from the wards I covering that I was not appearing to be too confident/not too sure what I was doing. It hurt my confidence a bit because everyone on the wards seemed so friendly and understanding that it was my first time on these wards, so I'm not sure what I did that would warrant feedback being given to my manager. If I had done something clinically incorrect I thought I would have been notified about that specifically.   


I feel like I'm not performing too well but am not sure if I'm just being too hard on myself and if the expectations my manager has of me are a bit unrealistic. I've only been working 2-3 shifts a week for 3 weeks and I'm not only getting use to all the new people, different types of cases but the entire hospital as well.

0,"Advice on my future Hello fellow dieticians 

I need some advice regarding a master I want to do. 

Lets start from the beginning. In high school I was always a hyperactive, attention seeking kid that couldn’t stay out of trouble. Eventually I was expelled from high school and was sent to a intermediate vocational education which prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, traditionally non-academic, and totally related to a specific trade, occupation, or vocation. I live in the Netherlands so the school systems are different. I’ll try to explain them as best as I can.

Anyhow I finished this education in 2 years and of I went to a university in applied sciences (This isn’t university yet, its less theoretical. In american standards its comparable to college). At first I chose a workingfield related to my prior education, which was in the legal services field. After like 5 months in my first year I realized that it just didn’t suit me. So I dropped out. Afterwards I started the study to become a physical therapist which I also dropped out of because it was in a different city than I lived in. The distance was pressing and I was like 20-21 and not really motivated to put in the work that was needed.( I really matured around my 23rd year). Around that time I started being more social and outgoing etc etc. and I do feel that that was where I started maturing. So I quit again. The year after physical therapy, I started in Nutrition and Dietetics. Which I sticked to. I am now in my final year and I plan on finishing it. Keep in mind, I chose these studies in my earlier twenties without knowing what I wanted. I just chose for the sake of studying, as my parents and environment wanted me to study.

During the first year of my dietetics study I started researching more. Thinking for myself instead of listening to the ‘’wiser’’ older people around me. I quickly found out that religion was a manmade construct. (I was raised in a muslim family). I started researching certain fields like evolution, biology, physics, chemistry, history etc. etc. I started developing. Now I am a 24 year old with decent knowledge about these subjects, thanks to myself. I have finally found myself in a state wherein I can make my own decisions. During my quest for answers I stumbled on the evolutional theory and biology, like I mentioned before. These have been my main interests for a while now and I have been reading a lot about it. Its amazing how we can predict animal and human behaviour, how are genes influence the ways we act and how these fields can answer big philosophical questions. I will start a minor about evolutionary psychobiology in my next semester so I am really stoked about that.

Here is my problem: I finally found what I want to do with my future. Best case scenario? Become a professor/teacher in the field of evolutionary biology. I want to study a biology master and major in evolutionary biology but the problem is that I cannot apply for a masters program in this field because of my prior education. Even with a pre-master they do not accept it. So now I am at this crossroad where I want to pursue my dreams and the field in science that I literally love but I am being blocked by this bureaucratic nonsense. I can’t do what I want to do because of the fact that my teachers in high school didn’t see me as worthy of their time. I will not accept this. 

Do any of you have experience with this? Did you go on to study a master, if so which one?",3521,633,0.9235

Starting counseling for weight management for a 68 year old female with a BMI of 56.

0,"Conundrum - ARFID vs. Digestive I have a referral for a patient with gastritis and a previously-bleeding (now healing) gastric erosion. The patient is a young adult, and has been underweight for the majority of their life, but has gradually dropped to a BMI of 13.7 over the course of this year due to an exacerbation of symptoms (loss of appetite, stomach pain, and diarrhea). 

Supposedly, the reason for the referral is due to the client having an immense fear of branching out from foods that don’t exacerbate symptoms (cooked vegetables, cooked poultry &amp; fish, fruit, and nut butters). In the past, they have experienced worsening symptoms when eating beans, dairy, and fibrous grains. However, their current “safe” diet is currently insufficient to support weight stabilization. 

Although I have experience working with EDs, I feel a bit at a crossroads. I am unsure if this case truly qualifies as ARFID, if the patient has reported difficulty digesting these foods in the past. At the same time, it seems as though fear of symptoms may be holding them back from trying foods that may have caused just one bad experience. 

Would you approach this as more of an ARFID case, working with the patient to reintroduce foods? Or would you approach it as a digestive case, working with the patient to increase calories based on tolerated items?",1350,226,-0.9607

She sent me an email afterwards essentially saying she doesn’t want anymore calls with me and that I’m not a good dietitian due to my saturated fat recommendation. She sent me several articles/research that suggest that saturated fat intake doesn’t affect heart health.   I sent her various links from eatright.org, dietary guidelines 2015-2020, and some research articles that suggest subbing saturated fat with unsaturated fat can reduce CVD risk.

0,"Current Nursing School student... thinking of switching to Dietetics and Nutrition major Hi all! 

I am currently enrolled in a nursing (BSN) program in California, USA. However, I’m not in love with the program. Like anything they say education is bound to have its ups and downs, but something doesn’t sit right with me about the approach to medicine and the general nurse culture (very dark humor, most hate their jobs or make jokes about hating their jobs, the long hours, mean preceptors, etc). The work is also something i thought i would love, and although i don’t hate it, it’s hard to imagine myself actually doing it for the rest of my life. 

I am keenly interested in dietetics. I have always had a deep interest in nutrition science and it’s application, but hadn’t considered making a career out of it until the past year when the thought of being in nursing has become increasingly hard to handle. Sadly, I switched to nursing after already opting out of a completely different major field in a completely different university. Beginning the road to nutrition would be my THIRD attempt at a freakin bachelors degree. However I think nutrition is really my passion, and I may want to go on to become a naturopathic doctor focusing on nutrition and digestive health later on once I’ve worked in the field for a while. 

Has anyone in this subreddit gone down this path? Perhaps from RN to RD or similar? Does anyone have advice or insight into these programs? How do you like your job?

Ps— there is some overlap in curriculum so I wouldn’t be set too far back. I have taken classes such as gen chemistry, anatomy, physiology, human biology, etc. I’m also a straight A student, and excel in math and science so I don’t think the nutrition program would pose too much problem for me academically. 

Pps—I am scheduled to meet with an academic counselor at my university within the next couple weeks.

I have yet another LTC question but I guess this could apply to anywhere that enters weights in to a computer system. Everyone on here has been so helpful and I don’t know where I would be without you guys &lt;3

So, I have been entering the weights into Point Click Care as the nurses give them to me. We have a real problem with large weight loss, broken scales, and reweighs taking forever (like 3+ weeks sometimes) to get done. So when I get a weight from a nurse that clearly needs a reweigh, I put it in the computer, tell the nurse I need a reweigh, and make a little note saying “discrepancy noted, will obtain reweigh”. But sometimes despite my best efforts and telling the DON, the reweighs don’t get done for a while. 

I was recently told to not put in any weights that need a reweigh until the reweigh is done which would be fine under normal circumstances but I would feel weird back dating a weight for last month when the reweigh is finally done and then it being not addressed. Or sometimes the reweigh is off by twenty pounds in another direction and then I have to wait forever to reweigh again. If the reweigh ever shows the first weight was in innacurate, I cross it out and make a little note. I offered to wait up to 72 hours after a weigh for a reweigh to get done but the admin said that wasn’t enough. 

Ugh, I’m really struggling with what’s the right solution! Obviously putting in unverified data isn’t ideal but I feel like documenting it is still important because the patient frequently did lose 20lbs and it’s important to know when that actually occurred.",1616,297,0.2083

I'm excited for this opportunity, but I am feeling in over my head. Aside from some clinical assessments (which I'm comfortable with), a big part of my new role is to develop community programs. I've never done this and I'm not getting any help. I was expecting to overlap a bit with the dietitian who is leaving and get some cursory training or ideas, but due to the pandemic it didn't happen. 

I need to develop programs for a community that is largely vulnerable with lower socio-economic status and many challenges with food insecurity. I have a meeting on Monday where I am meant to present my ideas. I HAVE NONE. :-( So far in my career, I've done a LOT of one-on-one consulting and that's IT. 

Being in the middle of a pandemic makes things harder too of course - things like cooking classes or a food market for example would be impossible to do with social distancing. The only idea I have so far is to provide healthy low-cost cooking classes via Facebook Live. I am lukewarm about this though, as many of my target demographic don't have access to technology.

https://www.onlinejacc.org/content/early/2020/06/16/j.jacc.2020.05.077

Abstract:
The recommendation to limit dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake has persisted despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group, without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, eggs and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD. The totality of available evidence does not support further limiting the intake of such foods.",1259,177,-0.762

0,"Need Advice on Outpatient Diabetes Educator Job  

TL;DR - Should I go on a leave from my job as a diabetes educator until the practice is actually ready for me?

I started working for a large primary care practice as a dietitian/diabetes educator in March, right before everything shut down. I worked for about 2 weeks in the beginning of March, before being furloughed, and recently returned to work in the beginning of June. I was hired to work 2 days a week, with room for growth.

There is a consultant who functions as the practice manager, who has been my point person/""boss"" (?) since I have began working there. My issue is that she has not done the necessary groundwork to establish a functional nutrition education program, and has instead has focused on billing and credentialing. For example, there is no referral system. The doctors refer anyone they think needs a dietitian (which is pretty much everyone), even though she wants me to only see diabetic patients for now. The practice sees about 200 patients a day, and it is literally impossible for me to see everyone that is referred to me. I keep asking the manager if she needs help establishing a clear referral system, but she just says she'll let the doctors know on her own. Another issue is that I don't have a proper space to see patients. They put me in a tiny spare exam room, with only a laptop and stool. There is no printer to print diet education, not even a desk to properly write on. I keep complaining to her about these limitations, but she keeps telling me to be patient while they set up my space. There is also no clear system for follow-up; the office staff just schedules people as they see fit. There is no communication between myself, the staff and the physicians. Everything goes through her, but she is terrible at communication. I truly believe that she rushed to hire me before getting things set up, and now that I'm there, she hasn't prioritized getting me a proper structure and set up.

I have been an outpatient dietitian pretty much my whole career, so I am very familiar with what it takes to establish a proper nutrition education program. When I returned in the beginning of June, I sent her a lengthy email basically outlining what I mentioned above, and told her I'd be more than happy to assist her in implementing these things, and if we couldn't do that, then I wouldn't return to work until they were in place. She emailed me back, and met with me in person assuring me that these things would be done, but so far nothing has been done.

Based on the things I mentioned above, would you be patient and stick it out, or let her know you'll be going back on leave, and will return when you have a proper space and program? Let me add - I also work part-time in LTC, so I don't need the money, but I do really enjoy nutrition counseling and the job has great potential. Help!",2884,521,0.9881

I am a student dietitian, and time and again I've been exposed to individuals who have just been blatantly rude rather than offer constructive criticism. For example, I recently had an interview with three senior dietitians that has really left me feeling defeated and mentally drained. I actually cried afterwards. From the very start of the interview, they were not warm at all (no smile, did not even introduce themselves and I had to ask them). During the interview, they kept interrupting me when I was speaking, exchanged looks between themselves and laughed at me as I was speaking, scoffed at some of my answers before rebutting them, checked their phones, checked the time on their watches and were overall just extremely condescending and demeaning. I understand stress interviews exist, but surely this is not acceptable. Someone who was more sensitive or had other issues may have actually been pushed to do something.

0,"LTC: Ethical differences between withholding/withdrawing feeding Hey guys, 

I'm having a difficult time with an assignment so I was hoping to get some real world experience on the topic. 

Is there an ethical difference between withdrawing or withholding feeding from a PVS pt and an adv. dementia pt that is refusing food and fluids. I was assigned yes.

0000

ETA (as I learn)
Beneficence: duty to to all that will benefit the patient and take positive steps to prevent/remove harm

Nonmaleficence: not intentionally cause harm.

Research findings: putting a patient with advance dementia on EN doesn't prolong life nor lower aspiration risk and will likely result in them becoming bedridden (ESPEN guidelines)

No evidence of medical benefit from feeding in adv dementia  and feeding tubes may cause harm. It is ethnically permissible to withhold feeding (Alzheimer's association)

Altertness major ethical consideration 


0000

The major differences I can see are 

religious: like in Judaism and Islam it is considered euthanasia if a pt is put on EN and then it is withdrawn and feeding isn't seen as desirable in the first place. 

benefit vs burden: in the pt with dementia EN isn't shown to prolong life and can increase discomfort by increased risk of aspiration

family belief: withholding feeding could mean not doing everything possible to provide care for pt with adv dementia while withdrawing would be acceptance that everything possible was done for the PVS pt.

Everything else seems to align that there is no ethical difference.  I'm also having difficulty accepting that because my grandmother is starting to refuse foods and liquids.

I love my boyfriends mom so much, she’s sweet, intelligent, introverted like me, and I really admire her for many reasons. 
However, she has a lot of engrained diet culture attitudes and it makes me really sad, but I don’t know what to do about it.
She lost a bunch of weight from 2+ hours of treadmill walking a day during covid19, is proud to be back to the weight she was on her wedding day, and only allows herself plain popcorn and dark chocolate as a treat. She has not missed a day on the treadmill since March 13.
She frequently tells me about her diet accomplishments, and I think she’s looking for validating/ congrats from me (as I am a dietitian).
I don’t want to say “congrats” or “that’s great”, because I really don’t think it’s great to unnecessarily restrict yourself. I have no idea what to say, so I just say “wow” or ...nothing at all. 
I want to point out that it’s a huge privilege to be able to focus on weight loss during a global pandemic, but I’ve only been dating her son 1.5 years and I wouldn’t say I know her on a deep level quite yet. 
She was already a very slender woman/low end of BMI before this!
I just worry about what she will think of me if I gain weight when I have children someday, or if she will think I’m less of a dietitian if my body fluctuates throughout my life. 
I truly take a weight-neutral approach to being a dietitian, and I help my patients eat and exercise intuitively (I do the same for myself). It makes me really happy to have the skills to listen to my body’s needs, including taking a break from the gym on days my body needs rest.

Hello dietitians of reddit, I’d love to share this little bit of good news. I just signed the paperwork for my first clinical FTE job!!

I’m in Australia, where the job market for clinical is bonkers competitive.

This isn’t my first FT job, however it is my first job as a dietitian. I’ve been working with a small start-up tech company since I finished in 2018 and we all know how notoriously difficult it is to get back into clinical once you’re out.

0,"Conflict of Interest for private practice RDs Hey everyone, I’ve gone down a rabbit hole with researching potential conflicts of interest and hoping someone on here may have some input. I work part time as an inpatient dietitian at a hospital and started my own private practice that just recently (like within the past couple weeks) has been fully good to go with accepting insurance. I made tear pad referrals and took them to a local MD group a few days ago and already have referrals coming in. Yay! 

So my question is, where do I need to tread lightly when it comes to promoting myself? Two scenarios come to mind. 1) attached to our hospital is a clinic with a gastroenterology office. I’d love to bring my referral pad to them also, but not sure if this is a conflict of interest since they are owned by the same company as the hospital. Our outpatient clinic that has a RD really only sees diabetes patients and has a 5 month waiting list, so it seems like promoting myself as an alternative would be increasing access to a dietitian and would be of benefit to patients. Scenario 2) can I mention my business if I’m working inpatient and a patient asks about seeing a dietitian once discharged? Am I able to give my business card?

My patient asked me a very good question.
Here is a little background: struggle with weight, heaviest she ever been, has mental health issues. 
For ex: she would eat a whole family pack size oreos throughout the day and nothing else. Then she feel extreme guilt and beat herself up and think of herself as a failure, etc. 
I said, that wt management is hard and reassure her she isnt any of those things, maybe we can work on healing her relationship with ""junk food"".
She asked: what should I do in this situation?? 
It stunted me. My answer was: focus on the positive of the food. Ex: it was a very satisfying oreo, soothe her craving (like it has a purpose) and journaling food and her feelings. But i feel that that is a weak answer.

Before C...19 the kitchen was able to offer fruit infused water in big water coolers but that has gone to the wayside for sanitation reasons. Several staff have asked me if they can get water enhancers such as mio and crystal light for each kids water bottle. My initial reaction is that it's ok, as long as staff is in control of giving the kids a very small squirt of it and they are making sure not to get the ""energy"" ones with added caffeine. I feel like this is a good way we can increase fluid intake.

I'm thinking about revising my portfolio plan so I can use it as a guide to my learning instead of trying to make CE's fit in categories just because it's what I've got (which is what I'm currently doing). 

So I've got a few questions to anyone who has done this before:

1. Should I NOT update my portfolio? I have over the needed 75 hours and have 3 more years until my cycle ends.
2. When I update my portfolio, will I lose all activities in my current activity log? Or will I just be able to set them to different competencies now?

0,"Two Job Offer Comparison (is experience really worth the pay cut?) Hello everyone, I’m a new RD since last month. I got offered two positions today. Both need relocating. They both rushed me to make a decision before the end tomorrow. Is this normal in Texas? 

One is a small company started by a dietitian. I’d be covering 8 long term care locations to provide MNT and perform kitchen sanitation surveys. I would be the only RD in that region that works for them. 18 work days a month, $27 an hour, 32-34hr/week (45,000-47,700). Health insurance, visit dental and 401K. They have PTO but prob not much since I’m already off 4-5 days a month on top of weekends. They apparently offer lots of education opportunities. For a starting RD, you can learn a lot pretty quickly. However, that area is more expensive to live in (1 bed apartment is about $800+ utilities) 

The other one is a rehab building attached to an acute hospital covered by a large food and nutrition contract company that hires thousands of dietitians. I would be covering about 60 beds in the rehab/post acute building and cover acute buildings one weekend out of a month. 40 hrs a week, 49k. There are 4 other RDs in the acute care building. All sorts of benefits on top of health insurance, vision, dental, PTO, holidays and 401k. Many I don’t see myself having the need for for years down the line. They do offer education opportunities as well but they do not seem to push for RDs to grow. This area is a small city with kind of high crime rates (407 in 2018, 274 is the national average). It’s cheaper to live in too. A 1 bed room apartment is about $600+ utilities. 

I personally favor the first one that paid less but has expedited growth since I’m brand new. With experience, I could get better positions in the future. Saving money right now is not a huge priority of mine. Although I can’t tell if the pay is not that great for that position. I used the salary calculator and it’s just below what it suggested (48,900). Since I have so little time, should I ask for more? 

TLDR; 

New RD. One job paid less, long term care and some food service, more expensive area, less benefits, expedited growth, 47,700/ year. The other paid more, rehab and occasional acute care. More benefits, less expensive are but high crime rate, 49,000/ year. Which is better? I prefer getting experience fast. Should I ask for more? Decision by Wednesday.",2414,433,0.994

&gt; # The Global Influence of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church on Diet
&gt; 
&gt; **Abstract**
&gt; 
&gt; The emphasis on health ministry within the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) movement led to the development of sanitariums in mid-nineteenth century America. These facilities, the most notable being in Battle Creek, Michigan, initiated the development of vegetarian foods, such as breakfast cereals and analogue meats. **The SDA Church still operates a handful of food production facilities around the world.** The first Battle Creek Sanitarium dietitian was co-founder of the American Dietetics Association which ultimately advocated a vegetarian diet. **The SDA Church established hundreds of hospitals, colleges, and secondary schools and tens of thousands of churches around the world, all promoting a vegetarian diet.** As part of the ‘health message,’ diet continues to be an important aspect of the church’s evangelistic efforts. In addition to promoting a vegetarian diet and abstinence from alcohol, **the SDA church has also invested resources in demonstrating the health benefits of these practices through research. Much of that research has been conducted at Loma Linda University** in southern California, where there have been three prospective cohort studies conducted over 50 years. The present study, Adventist Health Study-2, enrolled 96,194 Adventists throughout North America in 2003–2004 with funding from the National Institutes of Health. Adventist Health Studies have demonstrated that a vegetarian diet is associated with longer life and better health.

All existing COVID-related posts will stay up so users can access that valuable information and future ones will be auto-removed with users pointed here instead.

I was wondering if anyone knows of any organizations that are specifically interested in improving food quality (and quantity) inside correctional facilities and/or offering nutrition education to inmates? I recently read an article about the food served in various facilities throughout the US, and it literally hurts to see the way that incarcerated people are being fed. It makes me SO angry that not only are there issues with food-borne illness, spoiled foods, pests, etc., but there is obviously a preference for lowering costs over providing adequate nutrition. 

Healthy food and adequate amounts of food are basic human rights in my opinion and incarcerated people are being denied this. Think of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. How do we expect these people to improve themselves and reach ""self-actualization"" when their basic human needs are not met? We are setting them up for disease and malnutrition. 

As nutrition professionals, I think we are in a perfect position to advocate for them, and that is something I am incredibly interested in exploring.

I am currently an incoming senior at my school's DPD, and with the start of summer, I figured I should start taking a look at the AGSP sooner than later. One thing I started looking for right off the bat was programs that have low min. science GPAs because I'm certain this will be the weakest part of my application (my science GPA really is pretty horrible, being just below a 3.0). I've had no issue finding programs that are at or even decently below that minimum I need, but then comes a bunch of other factors that need to be taken into consideration. Lots of these programs may not necessarily have the concentration I'm interested in (community nutrition, wellness, nutrition education). Then there's the other issue of finding programs that are less competitive in terms of number applying vs. number accepted, and programs that have the ""optimal"" ranking of different application components with regard to potential strength of my personal statement, references, experience, and the different GPAs. 

I should also mention that I'm primarily looking for DI-only options. I know this presents yet another limiting factor, but for myself, I feel it's a much better decision to complete the DI and Master's separately. Whether the Master's or DI comes first likely will come down to if I'm matched next spring. Part of the reason for this is because I'm really interested in completing a Master's of Social Work or a degree centered around Child Development/Family Studies, which are degrees I haven't heard of being offered in combined programs...


Obviously for programs that have a min. science GPA that is too high they would likely not even accept my application, but for those that do have a cutoff that I'd make, what other factors should I be heavily considering? Just as a made up example: a program that has lower competition and/or a favorable ranking of application components, but doesn't have the concentration I'm interested in vs. a program that has higher competition, but has the concentration I'm interested in and/or a more favorable ranking of application components.

Anyways, I apologize for this massively long, rambling post but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to go about narrowing down whatever choices I may have.

I work part-time for a SNF as my second job. I have worked in various SNF's, as a consultant over the past 6 years in two different states. I have never once been asked to write a ""discharge note"" (from what I gather just a one-liner stating ""patient discharged on 'x' date, RD informed) and now at this new SNF I feel like management is constantly pushing me to get these done. 

With everything else I cover within the 8-16 hours I work per week this seems very insignificant. I was wondering if anyone knows if a ""discharge note"" from an RD is a CMS requirement?",606,111,-0.2132

0,"Typical work load? (SNF) I have been in the rehab/snf world for a few years now (no LTC just short stay). I am the only RD for a 96 bed building. We are almost always full census. We average about 150 admits a month (so roughly 40 admits a week), about 6 or so nutrition support patients a month, lots of wounds and dialysis patients as well. I interview and complete an eval on every new pt within 5 days of admit. I address every significant wt change (5%) with a note (I would guess about 40/week), and work with pt/family if unintentional loss. I also complete MDS, care plans, order supplements, update diets, change TFs, DC summaries, QA, attend morning meeting, etc. I would estimate I meet with about 12+ patients/day. I run a weekly wound/wt/nutrition support meeting and enter in progress notes on each pt. I am also expected to be doing in services, educations, audits, support food service team, safety sanitation audits, test trays, etc etc (which due to the clinical load I rarely am able to do the bare minimum). I am also the middle man for food complaints as kitchen staff is forever short. I work an average of 5-10 hours of overtime a week and I honestly feel like I’m usually doing the bare minimum overall. Does this sound like a typical work load? Am I just slow? I am so exhausted and feeling incredibly burnt out, can’t even take a day off as there’s no one to cover.

0,"Job advice So this is a super bizarre time but I'm actually questioning  accepting my ultimate job position if offered to me. So very shortly before my state (Ohio) issued stay-at-home orders (like 2 weeks before) I put in an application for my local WIC clinic. I had a really wonderful preceptor there who kept in touch with me after I graduated and sent me the application when the job was posted. I LOVED working at WIC during my internship. However I just received an email to interview, which I plan on doing but I'm a little nervous about taking a job that's so public facing during all this. 

I realize I am very privileged because even though I lost my jobs we aren't going anywhere or buying anything(other than food pretty much), so my husband makes enough to cover expenses for our household. 

Is anyone in this group working at WIC currently? What is it like right now? Do you feel relatively safe? Bonus if you live in Ohio where I believe they are still meeting face to face with clients( at least in my county).

I messaged her to let her know that she should be calculating that with kilograms, as using pounds is going to increase those recommendations by 2.2 and could be providing way too much protein for a person.

She essentially told me that I was wrong, this is what she learned through her “training.” I even looked to see what NASM says about this because I knew there was no way that was true, and they too say to use g/kg.

The ketogenic diet, colloquially called the keto diet, maybe a popular diet containing high amounts of fats, adequate protein and low carbohydrate. it’s also mentioned as a coffee Carb-High Fat (LCHF) diet and a coffee carbohydrate diet. It was primarily formulated for the treatment of epilepsy that didn’t answer medications for the disease.

The diet was originally published in 1921 by Dr. Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Wilder discovered that putting epileptic patients on a quick helped to scale back the frequency of the symptoms. At the time of its publication, there have been few other options available for the treatment of epilepsy.

The ketogenic diet was widely used for subsequent several decades in treating epilepsy both in children and adults. In several epilepsy studies, about 50% of patients reported having a minimum of 50% reduction in seizures....
