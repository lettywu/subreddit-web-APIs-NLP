I'm a new RD who started my career in my dream practice setting, the ICU, in September. I love my job, and for the most part I get along with my colleagues, but there are a few nurses who just cannot accept the fact that I am a quiet individual. Today a nurse approached my work station and said ""Orangeyak, you're so quiet. How many months have you been here for? You should make it your new year's resolution to be less quiet."" A few weeks ago, another nurse said something very similar to me, along with ""nobody knows your name because you're so quiet."" In both of these cases, their tone was not in good humour - they were complaining about me, to me. Last week, I overheard one of the charge nurses say ""she's socially awkward... comes in, doesn't say hi to anyone, and just puts her orders in"" and I'm 99% sure she was talking about me.

In my defense, I am 0.5 FTE RD who looks after a 20-bed ICU, fresh out of grad. I don't have time to socialize, let alone finish all my work in the 4 hours/day that I am paid for. Because I'm a 0.5, I also don't go to team rounds, which makes it harder to feel like part of the ICU team. I can eavesdrop on rounds from where I sit in the nursing station, and sometimes the team will call my name and tell me to ""start feeds on \[this patient\],"" but it's not the same as actually sitting at the rounds table.

I make an effort to say ""hi"" and ""bye"" and exchange ""how are you?""s, but rarely will I have a social conversation with any staff member because I am a) focused on getting my work done, and b) introverted. It takes time for me to get to know people and vice versa. Sometimes I will eat lunch in the break room (I normally buy lunch and eat in the caf), but rarely do I find I have anything to contribute to the conversation.

As an introvert, I've had to deal with ""you're so quiet"" all my life. Hearing it from my colleagues has really worn me down. I only have so much energy to give each day, especially in this climate, during this time of year. I never have anything bad to say about anyone and appreciate the personality quirks of all my colleagues, and it just hurts to know that they think I'm too quiet and socially awkward.

Just needed to get that off my chest. Can anyone relate?

dietetics,"Stage 3 pressure ulcer case Helloo, 

I’m a new RD and could really use some feedback on the latest learning experience I’ve had. 

I have a 56 yo F pt with a PEG and a recurring stage 3 pressure ulcer on foot. I’ve been feeling like shit all day because I was re-assessing and I realized that I may have previously gone overboard estimating her nutrient needs. 

Based off the current research I usually do 30-35kcal/kg for PU, more if underweight, etc and 1.2-1.5g/kg protein although I’ve read you can go up to 2g/kg based on stage of wound. 

Anyway I’m just feeling terrible because I estimated her needs to be 2,300kcal/day based off her weight of 172.8 and increased her rate slightly. she has had no significant weight gain/loss in 180 days but has been gradually trending upward. Everything else is stable, she’s tolerating the rate and BM are regular but I can’t shake the feeling of second guessing myself now and I feel paralyzed. 

The thing is she’s bed bound and immobile so I should have known to go lower, previous RD estimated needs at 1700 kcal, even with wound. 

I’m confused because I was taught to use 30-35kcal/kg plus or minus using professional judgement but the older RD I work with asked me why I didn’t use MSJ in a rude way and now I’m wondering when I use MSJ for wounds and when I use kcal/kg. 

Any feedback would be much appreciated (:",Stage 3 pressure ulcer case,"Helloo,

I have a 56 yo F pt with a PEG and a recurring stage 3 pressure ulcer on foot. I’ve been feeling like shit all day because I was re-assessing and I realized that I may have previously gone overboard estimating her nutrient needs. 

Based off the current research I usually do 30-35kcal/kg for PU, more if underweight, etc and 1.2-1.5g/kg protein although I’ve read you can go up to 2g/kg based on stage of wound. 

Anyway I’m just feeling terrible because I estimated her needs to be 2,300kcal/day based off her weight of 172.8 and increased her rate slightly. she has had no significant weight gain/loss in 180 days but has been gradually trending upward. Everything else is stable, she’s tolerating the rate and BM are regular but I can’t shake the feeling of second guessing myself now and I feel paralyzed. 

The thing is she’s bed bound and immobile so I should have known to go lower, previous RD estimated needs at 1700 kcal, even with wound. 

I’m confused because I was taught to use 30-35kcal/kg plus or minus using professional judgement but the older RD I work with asked me why I didn’t use MSJ in a rude way and now I’m wondering when I use MSJ for wounds and when I use kcal/kg. 

Any feedback would be much appreciated (:",2020-12-21 18:04:33

dietetics,"Question about taking un-planned medical breaks during the DI Hello all,
I am currently in a dietetic internship that is scheduled to run until June. However, I have a spine condition called scoliosis and its deteriorating (curves increasing). 

I recently consulted my surgeon who feels it is appropriate for me to pursue surgery. I need to get this surgery before I turn 26 which puts me at a March surgery date. 

I don't want to inconvenience my director and I still want to be able to finish my internship. 
How do I approach this situation in contacting my director and of anyone has any guidance if medical breaks are allowed. In addition i know the Academy recently changed the hour requirements for the DI from 1200 to 1000 and 600 of the 1000 being in authentic settings. Would I be able to have my director accommodate making the remainder of my hours online? (As I likely wont be able to go in person when healing and on heavy pain meds)

dietetics,"LTAC Dietitian MAR for supplements and EN? I work part-time in an LTAC facility with paper charting for the most part. Earlier this month the MAR system got an update where the supplements are no longer listed on them. I kept asking the nurses and CNAs about whether or not they have given the supplement to patients. A lot of them would tell me: no because they were not on the MAR and they did not know that supplements were ordered for them. It's apparently the night shift's job to write the supplements and EN orders in the new paper MAR, half of them don't do it and supplements would get missed. I'm only there for about 10-16 hours a week and can't effectively monitor when supplements were given (or not). Now my facility has a lot of patients that have wounds or have had major surgeries where I feel missing supplements is hindering patient's healing process. That's why I thought about wanting to implement my own supplement MAR that's easier to keep track of and audit. Has anyone done something like this? I would greatly appreciate any advice you have for me. All I could think of right now is to print off a sheet with Pt's names, supplements, and formulas, spots to sign for the nurses and CNAs with time blanks, then post it in the facility's nurses' station.

My preceptor was very encouraging and always tried to include me during the consults, to just jump in whenever, ask questions, provide education or recommendations.

Thankfully, my preceptor was extremely sweet, saying that eventually with more experience, I would build more confidence. Reflecting on my progress, I'm feeling quite down and incompetent.

dietetics,"Diet And Exercising For Weight Loss   

Obesity is now being called an epidemic in the health community. In fact, it will soon be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, even ahead of cigarette smoking. Obesity leads to type two diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or stroke, and even an increased risk of cancer. With all of these health risks, as well as the general improvement in the quality of life that can occur, losing weight is one of the best things that you can do for yourself.  
 

No matter what we would like to believe, there simply isn’t a magic solution to losing weight. The body will shed excess fat when it needs more calories to function through the demands you place on it in a given day than the amount of calories that you feed it. It’s that simple. So, in order to lose weight, you need to decrease the number of calories that you eat as well as increase the amount that you burn.  
 

There is a wide range of options to choose from when looking for a weight loss program. All of them often spend a lot of time explaining what to eat, in what amounts, and even at what times or in what combinations. But few of them emphasize the importance of exercise – not just for losing weight, but for your general health and wellbeing. Exercise is vital when trying to lose weight for several reasons:  
 

First, as you start to eat less, your metabolism will slow down somewhat. Exercising helps to elevate your metabolism back to an efficient level. Second, as mentioned, the exercise burns more calories so that you can lose weight faster and stay motivated in your efforts. Third, exercise actually releases endorphins, chemicals that keep your mood elevated.  
 

Exercise doesn’t have to mean spending hours at the gym or straining through exhausting workouts. In fact, in order for you to stick with it in the long run, exercising should be something that you enjoy. Start by increasing your activity level in an overall way. Take the stairs when you can. Park further from the mall door when you go shopping. Go for a walk in the park or through a neighborhood you love and bring a dog or a friend along for company. Take dance or martial arts lessons.  
 

Once you become more active in general, you’ll find it easier and more natural to move into regular exercise. Which you’ll need to do eventually in order to get regular, noticeable health benefits. You need to raise your heart rate to a fat-burning level and keep it there for at least 20 minutes, 3 times or more a week. However, if you don’t want to go to a gym, there are other options. Videos and DVDs are now available in all kinds of exercise types. That way you can change your routine whenever you want so that you don’t get bored with what you’re doing. Try a range of aerobics, kickboxing, yoga, or pretty much any activity you want right in the comfort of your own home.  
 

If you have physical limitations that would keep you off from exercising, you can still find a way to increase your activity level. Water aerobics is a wonderful option for those who have joint problems or limited mobility because it relieves the pressure on your body that your weight provides. But you still get the resistance to challenge your muscles from the water. There are even classes and videos available that let you exercise in a seated position.  
 

Whatever kind of exercise you choose, it’s important to stay motivated and keep it fun. Try gathering a group together to make it a social event. Or get a pedometer, a device that tracks how far you walk and see how many miles you can walk a week. Make a competition amongst your friends or family members and treat the winner with something special (not food-related!). Make the experience of exercising something that you look forward to, and it will soon become a regular part of your healthier lifestyle.",Diet And Exercising For Weight Loss,"

dietetics,"Is it ethical to treat family members in an inpatient setting? Purely hypothetical, but if a direct family member or grandparent, aunt, uncle were to be admitted inpatient and triggered for nutrition assessment, would it be ethical to be the dietitian on their case or would you pass it to another dietitian?

I feel like it would be hard to treat them like an actual patient if you know them. On the flip side, if you didn't have a good relationship with them, it might subconsciously impede the quality of care they receive.

dietetics,"I created a nutrition booklet guide for youths in group home foster care. Could I please have someone's thoughts? Hello! I am a newly graduated dietitian from Australia, and I have created a resource for an organisation I'm currently working with that looks after vulnerable youths in group home situations.

Part of what they do is equip these young people with skills they will need to succeed as adults. My role is to assist them with their understanding of nutrition and healthy eating, which is a big issue in this context. I have created this a while ago, but have recently been working on it much more and have tried to improve it.

If anyone has thoughts, I'd very much appreciate hearing them.

dietetics,"Psychology major with a large interest in nutrition. How should I steer my career? I'm 29. I currently have a BA in psychology and presently working in case management. Ever since I graduated high school, I have had interests in different careers and talents that I often didn't realize could translate into a career.

First, I wanted to work in IT. I attended a technical school and gained various certificates related to computer networking and repair services A+, Net + etc. Once I received those certificates and graduated from the program, I went on several interviews and eventually realized this wasn't for me.

I have always wanted a career that would bring me fulfillment, where I would generally feel happy to go to work every day. I could not see the IT field being that although I found working on computers easy. So this is where Psychology comes in, I have always had an ability to connect with people and have always loved giving advice. So I went to college and studied psychology with the plans to be a Counselor/ Therapist. I graduated in 2018 and have been doing case management work since, and although it can be rewarding, I feel like something is missing.

My real passion lies in nutrition, health, wellness, and fitness. These are things that I have honestly been interested in since I was in high school. Especially nutrition, which seems to come very natural to me (Thanks to my mother who believes in all things holistic).

I want to use my passion for helping others, but align it with the things I love to talk about and believe I can make a positive impact. I also want to live comfortably and not live paycheck to paycheck. If I need to get my masters what

How can I steer my current predicament to pursue this goal?

dietetics,"Struggling with my future... Nursing vs. Nutrition Hi! I currently hold a Bachelor's in anthropology but am taking prereqs at a community college so that I can apply for accelerated BSN programs next year. But... doubts grip me. When I started on this path of acquiring prereqs, it was with the aim to quickly get my BSN, then go on to get my MSN and become a Nurse Practitioner specializing in women's health. But since then, I've become obsessed with food and nutrition. 

Here are some of the things that I value in my future job/things that interest me: 

* Emphasis on preventative medicine 
* Emphasis on holistic healthcare 
* Advising patients on their diet and lifestyle choices
* Women's health
* Probably working in a non-hospital setting as I don't want the erratic hours
* A decent amount of monetary security
* Easily available jobs -- aka I could move anywhere and find a post with relative ease.

However, I’d consider if those who got a masters found it beneficial. I am also worried with the new Masters requirement in 2024, I would be competing for jobs against those with Masters which makes me nervous as it seems it is already hard to get a job.

She’s gotten close with two in person interviews and not selected for both an RD in patient per diem (16 hrs a week) and a temporary per diem outpatient also 16 hrs a week. There was also a posting as clinical that was advertised for a day and then when she asked about the position with HR, she was told the job was filled. The HR person told her shed keep her in mind for an open position but then never contacted her.  I’m in the health care field and got a job as a Medical Technologist right out of my internship. Mostly all job ask for at least one year of experience. How can she get experience when no one gives her a chance?",2020-11-24 23:29:42

Looking for feedback on my resume and any advice

* &gt;!Graduated in 2018, didn't do internship b/c of cost and experience (to make up for some poor grades during a bad year for me). Planned to get my dtr and find work.!&lt;
* &gt;!Took a retail job in the meanwhile (which i regret so much, don't even like thinking about it).!&lt;
* &gt;!Studied and got the courage to take the test (crippling test anxiety) and failed by 1 point.!&lt;
* &gt;!Got discouraged again and decided to retake courses at a community college to apply to an acclerated nursing program.!&lt;

* &gt;!The p@nd3m!c happens a few weeks after I get my rejection, i finish out my courses!&lt;
* &gt;!Started studying again for my dtr during the summer. I pass :)!&lt;
* &gt;!Now looking for nutrition-related work. (It's ironic, while studying i saw a whole bunch of listing for dtr's in my area but, I couldn't apply because I wasn't official).!&lt;

This [resume](https://imgur.com/crxarGg) is an offshoot of a resume I took to a career advisor at my college some months after I graduated. Wondering if I should change the format to a more modern one and take off some of the bullets. Is it long winded?

For the health coach job, it's a freelance thing, currently building my website and sm pages.

I also had a resume with courses I took in undergrad but I'm guessing it's not relevant anymore since I graduated 2 years ago.

I think i'm just going to try my luck and apply to some d.i's, at this point, why not?

I've been an RD for 4 years, working at an outpatient and IOP level at an ED treatment center and have been looking at next steps. A virtual private practice seems like a good fit, logistically, but what's been holding me back is the ""business"" part, as I'm sure a lot of RDs have run into.

To be honest, I'd love to just work for a practice/treatment center as an outpatient RD so someone else can handle all the business/finances/marketing and focus on the counseling work, but don't see those hiring often. 

I hate using social media (aside from Reddit lol) and the idea of putting my picture and myself ""out there"" is enough to make me not want to do private practice at all. It also feels so saturated and pointless to have another IE Insta. 

Is it realistic to hope to maintain at least a small caseload without marketing through social media? Are random databases (like the certified IE counselor or my state's RD databases) and some networking typically enough? I'm only hoping to keep ~5-10 clients at a time at first while I keep my current FT position. 

Does anyone have advice on the easiest ways to handle all the non-nutrition parts of private practice with the least involvement? Like business management companies or easy-to-use EHR/scheduling/billing platforms?

I am about to start my first job as a RD and feel a little overwhelmed. I sought out employment at a county hospital, as this patient population is my passion and whole heart! They hired me as the RD for their HIV/AIDS clinic and I am beyond excited to share my compassion as well as my nutrition expertise! However, I am the only RD in the clinic! On one hand, this is great because I have free range and feel very valued; on the other hand, I have no one to guide me in the right direction or offer their nutrition expertise/experiences in HIV/AIDS. 

From previously interning at a county hospital and in multiple community settings, I am very aware of the barriers the community faces ( ex: financial); however, I still find it hard to provide nutrition advice based around affordability. I feel more prepared for the counseling aspect rather than the nutrition aspect! Ironic, I know!!

Can any one share their wisdom or provide resources that may come in handy? Any bit of advice would be greatly appreciated!!",HIV/AIDS,"Hello fellow RDs!

This might be a long shot..I have a case of glucerna that expired 1-2 months ago and I was wondering if anyone has any insight as to if it's still safe?

With most highly processed food I would assume yes, given that expiration dates are usually in regards to a decline in quality/taste (at least with food) rather than safety but I'm not sure in this case.

With ""current world events"" leaving so many folks food insecure it feels incredibly wasteful to toss a whole case out if it's safe. Does anyone know of where the donation would be accepted?

Basically, there aren't many people who can speak on behalf of my clinical skills/patient interactions for future job search (6 months from now). How important is it to have a manager as a reference? Will it look bad if those 2 RDs serve as my references? How long after your internship is it inappropriate to ask your preceptors to be your reference?

Also, I am very shy and find it difficult to form strong professional relationships with others.",2020-11-15 22:38:32

dietetics,"New RD - Need Career Advice Job hunting during a pandemic has not been easy, especially in my field and hometown where it is very competitive with few jobs. I spent a good 3 months searching/applying for jobs only to have either not heard anything back or be rejected due to having ""no experience"" (I am fresh out of college). Last week, I finally got a job offer from a company that pays well for entry level and has decent benefits, the only downside is that I would have to move to an area with an extremely high cost of living. I calculated a bunch of apartments on the market to gauge how much I would be spending if I moved. If I want a decent and safe place, I would only be saving a little under 2K every month. The more affordable areas are in areas that are not as safe, however, I would be saving a little more than 2K a month but there are obviously risks. Regardless of where I decide to stay, I will be paying at least 1.5K-2K a month for an average/older place which I am not thrilled about. 

My field puts a lot of emphasis on experience and having even 6 months of experience on your resume can make a huge difference on whether or not you get an interview. My only motivation for taking this job at this point is to get that experience and leave after 1 year (maybe less). I'm just not positive if this is the right decision for me. The way I look at it, I have two options: I either turn it down and risk having no job for the next 3-6 months (this is an *assumption*, but looking at how long it took me to get ONE interview and offer I would say this is definitely a possibility) with hopes that some how I land a job here **OR** I take this job and barely get by (again, will only save a little less than 2K every month after rent, food, gas, etc.), however it allows me to gain experience and may help open doors for jobs back home where I am from and have family. 

I guess I just need advice or even just personal stories on what others did in this situation. Did anyone else make a sacrifice (such as paying high rent, being alone in a new area with no friends or family, barely being able to save up money while working due to high cost of living) to gain experience in their field and for their future? How did it work out for you? I think my indecisiveness comes from the possibility of NOT finding a job in my hometown if I do turn this one down.

dietetics,"Resume Question Hopefully I'm posting this question in the right place!

I am currently a Diet Tech at a hospital system which is also a medical school/research facility. When I started at this position, I was a part time working for the research/university side of the hospital system. After two years I transferred to a more clinical position in the actual hospital that was full time. 

I'm wondering if I should list these two experiences as separate positions on my resume, even though technically, I've been a diet tech with the same company for 5 years?

Would the two years I spent as a research diet tech count as research experience?

I am a new dietitian in LTC and while we do have therapeutic diets some of my carb control residents are super picky and get select menus but only want carb based foods. As far as I understand state laws are that residents can make their own choices, if they refuse a carb control diet they can do so. It’s is my job to educate them on their choices. 

Today I was going through a menu with a picky DM resident who literally will not eat meat because he’s on mechanical soft. Hates it ground. The nurse came into the room and started talking about DM residents and how their blood sugar are high because of all the carbs we give them. She’s kinda a problem nurse around here when it comes to DM residents. 

My question is how do you manage diabetics in LTC who refuse a carb control diet? How do you handle the nursing staff trying to take food and juice away from them?

Question: In what ways can I help prepare myself for becoming an RD? 

I'm currently working on my associates, still working on knocking out my gen ed. It will take me until at least mid 22 to graduate. I thought in the meantime it would be good to start working on chemistry little by little because I know that it will be a problem area for me. What things can you think of that I can start working on now to make things easier for myself later? Math is a big problem area for me, which I know in turn will make science more difficult.

What did you struggle with? What are your regrets? Is there something I can learn from your experience? 

 My dad has suggested that I learn the entire periodic table of elements because in school he was not able to look at a chart and didn't do well on some of the tests because he didn't take the time to memorize all of them. I think that is one of the places I will start unless someone has some more recent information on that.

dietetics,"Study Struggles In my first semester and first year of classes. Taking some foundational nutritional courses. 

I want to really learn and retain the information, so I have been working hard at studying. But, I am in an advanced trajectory course, so 15 weeks of work, in 7 weeks. My method of studying has been to read the chapters and as I go along, to take notes on the chapter sections . . . This has been helpful in the sense it gives me a reference and quick lookup for assignments and studying for exams. But it’s been difficult that it has caused me to take probably 4 times as long to get through a singular chapter, and we typically have to read 3 chapters a week for one class. And I work a full time job so my windows for schooling are slim.

dietetics,"Toxic, unprofessional boss/ Advice for applying and interviewing for new jobs? I've been at my first RD job for a few months. I'm currently the only ""full-time"" clinical dietitian at my hospital and my manager has made it clear over the last few months that she is an unprofessional/ toxic person. Examples: We have a shared office and she leaves her door open and talks negatively about other people in the department or other hospitals (she will often call people by derogatory names like bitch, asshole, and she will go on and on complaining for hours). It stresses me out and I don't want to shut my door because she's made comments about that as well (Oh, am I talking to loud? Am I bothering you? etc). She has made rude/ accusatory comments to me on several occasions. She seems as if she likes to assume the worst of people but she really does not know me and has made no attempts to ask me how I'm doing since I started here. She will even straight-up ignore me (says hello and goodbye to everyone else except for me, just really bizarre behavior). I told her I had a maintenance emergency in my apartment and that I could either work from home or I'd have to take off work so I could have a plumber come over and she directly accused me of lying. I was appalled. 

I have overheard her complain to other people that she can't assess my work because she isn't ""technically qualified"" as she says (she is a CDM) so I am wondering if her behavior comes from a place of insecurity/ ego.. not that I care so much about the motivation behind her behavior, but my point is that I don't think it's a personality conflict as much as it's that she feels she has something to prove by treating me badly (if that makes sense?).  The majority of the very few interactions I've had with her - and trust me, I try to limit them - have been negative despite my best efforts to be polite and professional. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt because I don't like to judge people based off first impressions, but after a few months I'm convinced she has some kind of cluster B personality disorder or something. I really feel like I have a high school bully for a boss... and I have no plans to complain or approach her about it, as she has been in the position for about 10 years and I know it won't do any good.

So I'm dealing with her behavior as best I can (mostly dismissing her lack of professionalism and trying to focus on my work and gaining valuable clinical experience in my limited time at this hospital), but I'm worried about applying to jobs without a manger reference after this (I will definitely NOT use her, but maybe another PRN dietitian I work with 1 day a week). I'm PRN covering for the full-time dietitian right now while she is on medical leave, so this isn't a permanent thing at least.... I just worry that this is just going to look terrible to potential employers. She obviously can't speak to my work performance due to her lack of qualifications and I'm sure she would talk negatively about me to any potential employer after hearing the way she talks about other people. Have you been in a similar situation as an RD? I could really use some advice as far as how I can phrase questions about my work environment during future interviews, avoid sounding negative, etc. I worked with many clinical dietitians and clinical managers in my internship that were ALL wonderful so I know this isn't the norm, I'm just frustrated and having anxiety mainly about applying to other clinical jobs after this. Side note, if any experienced clinical dietitians/ hiring managers wouldn't mind giving some resume advice I would GREATLY appreciate that as well. Please feel free to PM me.

I'm currently working on my associates and likely won't graduate until '22 or '23. 

\-  How do I know if need to take a Didactic, coordinated, or future graduate program? I've also read that there are distance programs. I think from what I have read the coordinated program is what I want, but I'm not 100% sure. 

\- Wherever I decide to take classes will need to be accredited when I start right? If the accreditation term ends while I'm attending that school, will I need to transfer to an accredited school to complete my degree? 

\- I've read that starting 2024 you will have to have a masters to take the CDR. Does that mean I will need to pick an accredited school that offers a masters?

dietetics,"Possible future dietician Hey everyone! 

I am very interested in pursuing a career as a dietician but I want to hear some personal experiences: the good and the bad. I want to know the pros and the cons - every little detail. Here are some additional questions I have as well:

- According to Google, the average pay is around $60,000. If you feel comfortable sharing, is this true for you? I know this is an opinion based follow up question but do you believe the average pay increase since they will be requiring a Masters after 2024?

- Did you struggle getting a job. Please explain if so And do you feel as though the demand will increase or decrease? Have you worked at multiple different locations I.e. hospitals, private practices etc.

- Are most RD’s employed by hospitals? I know there are other employers but I’ve only been able to find information on RD’s who are employed by hospitals. If you do not work for a hospital, would you mind sharing where you work and what your day to day experience is? Good and bad please.

- I see a lot of posts about nurses and doctors not taking RD’s seriously. Is this true for you? Do you feel as though you are not taken seriously by your peers? Is there a field I could minor in or maybe double major in that would coincide with Dietetics that would better prepare me and help others to take me seriously?

- what does your work schedule look like? I’m interested if an RD, who work in a hospital, has more of a nurses schedule that’s all over the place or if they have set hours. I’m also interested in the schedules of those who do not work at a hospital.

- is it worth it? It’s expensive and a decent amount of school especially since I will have to get a Masters. I just want to make sure I’m making a sound decision.

Please share the aspects you love and hate! If you could prepare a future Dietician for anything what would it be? What do you wish you knew before hand?

dietetics,"Only living of essential amino acids? Bioavailability? Hey, so I’m going to have surgery and will stay in the hospital for about one week. Since I don’t tolerate literally(!) most of the foods, I wondered how I should give my body sufficient nutrients to heal. 
Thought it could be an option to just get an essential amino acid powder. 
Since I can’t store or prepare fresh foods I won’t be able to have my usual egg yolks which I basically live of. Also butter won’t be practical, and since I can’t have plant oils (which would be easy to store at room temp) I’ll lack a fat source.

_My question: does it negatively affect bioavailability of amino acids if they are consumed only by themselves?_

(Maybe I’ll add in NAC, selenomethionine, sulfurophane, Quercetin, vit C or some b vitamins, but that would be about it.)

I had to have my supervisor contact the COO of our facility and the orientation trainers supervisors and it still wasn't enough and the issue has to be approved by the CEO for me to continue training?!

Financially it's not a huge factor for me as I am blessed to be working for self-fulfillment vs need. 

So...what would you do? Would you leave the current employer in the lurch? Suck it up for a few months doing both (and working WAY more hours than I had intended with a large family at home)? Or tell the new offer thanks but now is not a good time for me.  I'm struggling with not letting anyone down I think.",2020-10-31 14:10:15

So I'm a brand new RD. I just landed my first job and I'm super excited. I'm working on a masters in human nutrition as well and I will be done next July.

In school, I remember learning a lot about the nutrients required at different stages of pregnancy, but we only really learn that babies should be exclusively breast/formula fed for the first 6 months of life. I know that if a pregnant woman doesn't consume enough folic acid, the baby is at risk of spina bifida, but what happens if a baby has been given barely any food for her first six months?? What sort of psychological and physical consequences would that have in the long run? 

Babies are so fragile and can die for no reason at all. There are so many dos and don'ts when it comes to feeding a baby, and many adults find it difficult, so I am amazed that a 12-year-old boy was able to keep her alive.

dietetics,"Left the RD world First off, I apologize in advance for this lengthy post. Feel free to scroll past if this doesn’t resonate with you. Things have been extremely emotionally difficult for me the past two months and I need an outlet. 

I made a post a few weeks ago about my DI experience and the severe depression and anxiety I was spiraling into because of how much I hated the program I was in. It manifested into physical symptoms - sleepless nights, barely eating 500 cals/day, thoughts of not wanting to be alive so I didn’t have to experience another day as an intern, hair loss, rash outbreaks, and weeping sessions and breakdowns at the internship site. I had a therapist and even that wasn’t helping enough. He suggested that I leave the program to which I responded in complete shock, convinced that that was NOT a viable option or even an option period. But he made a statement that truly opened my eyes - if I stuck around and pushed myself beyond the limits of what I wanted, I would’ve been a train wreck by the end of it all and god knows how long it would take me to recover from the trauma. 

Over the years, I grew a huge aversion for this field due to the suffering I had to endure to get to the internship and the genuine disinterest I had when nutrition-related topics were brought up and that feeling of my heart dropping to my stomach if anyone asked me a nutrition question. Honestly, I only pushed myself to pursue this pathway because throughout the entire education process, the RD path and the traditional roles were heavily pushed upon us and anything that was less than or non-RD, seemed to be frowned upon.I had no intentions of utilizing the credentials once I passed the exam. I simply wanted the credentials just to have them and was contemplating day in and day out whether it was even worth it to put myself through that just to have something I wouldn’t use.

Well, fast forward to present day. I withdrew from the program because I felt it drove me over the edge. I’m still sulking in guilt at the fact I took a spot from someone who really wanted it and all the money and time that was invested to get to this point. I feel like this will haunt me for the rest of my life. I’m not sure where to go from here or how to cope with these terrible thoughts. I like talking about food. I’m passionate about sustainability and farms/gardening, and getting in touch with nature. I care about where my food comes from and how it affects people, society, and the environment.

The bright side is I was just able to land a non-RD job at a nonprofit organization helping refugees and immigrants acclimate to America and one of their larger programs partners with local retailers to provide them with nutritious meals. So in a way, I am definitely still utilizing my knowledge from school and I know this will be so rewarding. I’m also considering transitioning into a business career within the natural food sector and can’t help but feel like having the RD would be an asset. However, the thought of having to go through an internship program again actually makes me sick. 

For those of you who transitioned out of the RD world, have a job that doesn’t require the credentials or never ended up pursuing the RD pathway, what do you do now and are you happy in your position?

I completed about 75% of the practice questions in Inman, but really wasn't fond of them. The prep app is great as it explains the answers, whereas Inman had me scratching my head a lot of times.

I forced myself not to get locked up in a decision and overthink. Paralysis by over-analysis. Know yourself and what studying habits work. There's more than enough recommendations on how to study.

If so, can nursing document the resident isn’t receiving the supplement so I don’t feel like I’m living a lie and look stupid asking the resident about the supplement? I’m sure this happens in many LTC facilities but it’s frustrating.

- Unrelated, does anyone know how to strike out weights in PCC? I’ve found I have to ask nursing every time I want an inaccurate weight striked out.

However I’m doing a cross country move in a few weeks for spouses dream job and have been interviewing for jobs. I have a second interview next week in an outpatient clinic at a major hospital and am getting a little nervous if I were to actually get the job (they said it’s last interview).  The job is well paying with benefits and close to my husbands job so would be ideal  (though I am grateful for getting a surprisingly high number of interviews in short time in a city that’s apparently hard to get a job.

dietetics,"I need some advice or another person's opinion Last week I found out I have ADHD and it overwhelmed me with sadness because I finally found the reason why I was never able to pay attention in class or commit myself to anything. I took medication for the first time and I cried. I always felt like the dumb kind and always wanted to just graduate and get the heck out of college so I can get a job in this field already, but the problem is that I feel like I severely underachieved.

I'm graduating this semester with a Foods and community Nutrition major with a Health education minor. Looking back it really doesn't sit well with me that I sold myself short and took a major that only required the core requirements from the original dietetic major. I want to graduate and find a job in the nutrition field, or maybe as a personal trainer. I'm kind of lost and have no real guide on how or what to do after college. I kind of just pick this major just to pick a nutrition major since my college was paid for by FAFSA. If I ever want to go back, FAFSA is not going to pay anything since I'm going to receive a bachelor's.

(I thought of maybe failing one of my classes (credit/no credit)  so I won't graduate so I can come back and switch my major again to dietetics and go at it again so FAFSA can help me but I don’t know. I'll talk to my advisor about that.

Looking into it i also noticed that besides being an RD, which i can't do atm obviously, what else is there? I feel like I'm over qualified to be a personal trainer but I'm underqualified as an RD. I also don't know how to get a personal trainer certification so I'll have to look into that.

 I also have a 3.1 gpa and the internship needs something like a 3.6 or something, so I'm screwed there. I'm not sure if I can also take some professional requirements in a community college like Ochem or Anatomy. I scheduled a meeting with my advisor If I ever want to come back or maybe take classes at a community college.

I probably didn't really need to write this since I'm gonna talk to my advisor, (hopefully), and everything is going to be sorted but i really wanted to get this off my chest. I don't necessarily want to work as an RD, but i really want to go back since now I know the real truth behind why school was so hard for me.

Hi everyone. I know this has been all over this sub, but I felt like I had to post it. I just graduated with my bachelors. I applied for internships, but didn’t match. I am now finding out this degree is useless without being an RD. I really regret getting this degree. It was always encouraged to work with WIC and SNAP and other areas if you didn’t get matched. There are no jobs like that in my area right now, so I am applying to WIC jobs a few hours away. I took my DTR exam, but failed by one point. Even then, there is only a few DTR jobs in my area and they are all part time and pay crap. I don’t have money for a masters, and it doesn’t seem like there are any useful masters degrees that allow my bachelors. I had a hard time in school with depression and anxiety and I feel so hurt and cheated by everyone and everything. I feel like my DPD program was not upfront about costs, internships, DICAS, everything. This is the worst my depression and anxiety has ever been. I started taking medication again, but it’s only been a couple a days so I guess I’m still waiting for it to work. All I have done is cry for the last couple of days. I feel like everyone around me is doing great and here I am with this useless degree. My plan is to work with WIC for a year, save money up for an internship and apply again. I also might get my CNA and apply for nursing school and get an associates in that as a backup. What worries me is how competitive nursing schools are😕I don’t think my grades are too bad, but their not too good. Also nervous about the teas test, but I would get a tutor for that. Nervous about the classes too. It looks like a WIC nutritionist pays around 30,000-40,000?  And an associates in nursing starts out at 40,000 but as a dietitian I would start out at around 50,000-58,000. So would it even be worth it’s for nursing? I think my depression has made me feel lost and not sure of what I want to do. I’ve always imagined myself in a decent apartment and decent pay. I don’t have to have luxury, but I want to be able to support myself and have some extra money If I need it. I’ve always been interested in nursing, but never tried it due to my anxiety. All I ever wanted was to get a decent paying job and move out of my parents house, but I feel like every decision I have made has made me stay here longer.

dietetics,"Let me guess...you don’t want a feeding tube? I work in outpatient oncology. Many of my head/neck, esophageal, and lung cancer patients have dysphasia and need feeding tubes. I have yet to meet a patient that agreed right away to having a feeding tube placed. Many patients suffer a lot of weight loss and other side effects related to poor nutrition before agreeing to tube feeding.


One clinic I service has moved toward placing feeding tubes prophylactically for certain head/neck patients. These patients have done really well during treatment. I think having multiple disciplines supporting TF at the beginning is helpful. I have also found that many patients think TF is all-or-nothing. Explaining that they can continue to eat and drink orally (if safe to do so) with a feeding tube seems to help. 


Does anyone have additional advice, methods, or educational materials that have helped convince a patient to get a feeding tube?",Let me guess...you don’t want a feeding tube?,"I work in outpatient oncology.

dietetics,"Mental health and starting a DI So I am graduating in December and have applied for DI's. I have one interview tomorrow and another later this week. I've always struggled with anxiety and depression even with medication, but also focus, boredom, decisions, and memory and I've come to the realization recently that I may have ADHD.

Aside from the irony that I'm only realizing this as I'm finishing my degree, I'm also grappling with the decision of what to do next. I know I want to get testing and therapy (just in general), but I'm wondering if it's even appropriate for me to be starting a DI when balancing my mental health is already a full-time job and there's a possibility of starting new medications. And medication will have to be changed and adjusted, maybe not even just ones for ADHD but my anxiety and depression ones too. When I started anxiety meds for the first time I was an absolute trainwreck while they took time to kick in and again 6 months later when I needed a new prescription.

If I get a match, I will be moving hundreds or thousands of miles from where I am now, from family and home, and my long term boyfriend so I'll be isolated from my support system. But I'm 24 and I really do want to be registered and work in nutrition. I feel like time is running out (though logically I know it's not).

dietetics,"Is it only on low income countries that dietitians do enteral nutrition calculations? So I was just thinking about this and many many other questions that I have about how Dietetics is practiced on other countries. 

I’m from Central America and I’m a Dietetics student about to finish my degree. I did my clinical internship at the most important hospital of the country. My family is planning to move to the US and maybe just maybe I will also move to study my MSc in the US or Canada. 

I always tried to get information from the Academy, ASPEN, ESPEN, FELANPE, etc. to do our job at the hospital. Can you imagine there’s not even a protocol on what in the world we must do in hospitals once we get to our internship? I was so amazed at this that I couldn’t believe I did 4 years of university education to end up in a place where NOBODY had an idea why I was there. 

So, I’ve always been very passionate about everything I do. I can’t handle things that are done poorly. So I designed a proposal on what a Dietetics student must do and accomplish on their internship at least on the hospital we were working on. Yes, it’s THAT badddd! A student doing the job of an adult. 

I tried to standardized everything I could and propose work protocols. And i tried to gather as much evidence I could to inform what was our role, why we do what we do and how we could accomplish that in our hospital. 

Did you know there is not ONE SINGLE dietitian working inpatient on the most important hospital of the country?! There is SO MUCH need that I wish I could do more but it is so overwhelming. 

SO, going back to my question and after giving you guys a bit of my background and why my internship was so frustrating but so enriching at the same time, do you guys from rich countries also do enteral calculations? 😹 what I mean is this: 

So we have available basic enteral formulas. We DO NOT have special formulas. We do calculations of nutrition requirements and “modulate” feedings depending on what we need. We use powdered milk, cornstarch, Karo syrup, coconut oil, Proteinex powder, and other ingredients to modulate the diets. 

When I go to Abott’s webpage for example, i see so many options we don’t ever have available here. What if you need an isocaloric diet, you must modulate it. If you want it high protein, you must add it. If you want it lower carbohydrates, you must modulate it, and so on and so on. 

We must experiment with the formulas available and different ingredients to achieve what the patient needs. So I was wondering if this is something done only here or is it actually a normal thing to do in Dietetics no matter where you are? 

We have so many needs in the hospital I tend to think we are the only ones that have to deal with this and probably we’re not the only ones 😟",Is it only on low income countries that dietitians do enteral nutrition calculations?,"So I was just thinking about this and many many other questions that I have about how Dietetics is practiced on other countries.

dietetics,"A Week of the Keto Diet: 7-Day Keto Meal Plan **Day 1: Monday**

Total net carbs: 20.7g

Breakfast (4.6g net carbs): Eggs Scrambled with Sautéed Onions and Cheddar Cheese

Snack (2g net carbs): Atkins Peanut Butter Fudge Crisp Bar

Lunch (5.8g net carbs): 6 oz deli ham over 2 cups mixed greens with ½ Hass avocado, 5 large black olives, ½ cup sliced cucumbers, and 2 Tbsp blue cheese dressing

Snack (4.5g net carbs): 3/4 medium zucchini cut into sticks and 2 oz provolone cheese

Dinner (3.8g net carbs): Baked Catfish with Broccoli and Herb-Butter Blend

Keto tip of the day: Low carb diets like Atkins keto have a diuretic effect, so make sure you’re drinking at least 6 to 8 glasses of water each day. Not consuming enough water—especially when starting a new low carb diet—can lead to constipation, dizziness, and sugar/carb cravings. Also make sure you add extra salt to your diet in order to make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes. Try sipping on full-sodium broth or adding a little extra salt to your food.

**Day 2: Tuesday**

Total net carbs: 20.6g

Breakfast (5g net carbs): Atkins Frozen Farmhouse-Style Sausage Scramble

Snack (4.4g net carbs): 1 cup sliced red bell pepper with 2 Tbsp ranch dressing

Lunch (5.8g net carbs): Bacon-Cheddar Cheese Soup

Snack (2.2g net carbs): 1 stalk celery with 2 Tbsp cream cheese

Dinner (3.2g net carbs): 7 oz bone-in pork chop with Cauliflower-Cheddar Mash

Keto tip of the day: Get moving! Exercising regularly can help you achieve ketosis by aiding your body in using up its excess glucose before storing as glycogen. It’s normal to feel a bit sluggish when starting a keto diet, so if you’re new to the low carb lifestyle, stay active with low-intensity movement like yoga and walking. When you’re feeling more energized, add in some high-intensity exercise a few days a week.

Keto tip of the day: If you are new to a low carb lifestyle, you might start to come down with what’s known as the keto flu. A term coined by the keto community, this is a temporary side effect experienced by some people when they start the keto diet. If you are experiencing headaches, weakness, and poor concentration, don’t throw in the towel! Electrolytes and water are quickly depleted when you first start a keto diet, so make sure you are drinking plenty of water and consuming a little extra sodium and potassium. It also helps to get adequate sleep and make sure you are eating plenty of healthy fats.

Keto tip of the day: It’s the end of the work week, so meet up with your friends or family for dinner! Living low carb doesn’t mean you have to cook every one of your meals.

Keto tip of the day: Low carb diets like Atkins keto have a diuretic effect, so make sure you’re drinking at least 6 to 8 glasses of water each day. Not consuming enough water—especially when starting a new low carb diet—can lead to constipation, dizziness, and sugar/carb cravings. Also make sure you add extra salt to your diet in order to make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes. Try sipping on full-sodium broth or adding a little extra salt to your food.

1. **You CAN be selected for a random audit on your very 1st cycle**. So start organizing early! I regretted how lax I'd been on this. From now on, I will scan any paper certificates of completion in and keep them all organized in a folder for easy uploading should I get audited again. Just tossing them in a folder doesn't count as organized!
2. ""CDR has begun sending audit notices when the minimum number of required CPEUs and an ethics activity have been logged."" &lt;&lt;- Reminder that i**t's best to log your CEU's as you get them instead of waiting to input them all at the end**. That way, when you reach this requirement, you will get notified if you are selected for an audit early! For example, my cycle doesn't end until May 2023, but since I input all my CEU's so early, I could have taken 3 years to submit my audit paperwork! 
3. The older RD's I worked with assumed that the more CEU's you log, the less likely you'd get picked for an audit. They also assumed that you could not be selected for an audit BEFORE submitting your log for approval. Not true! See #2 for audit selection. 
4. I had 5 CEUs denied for very stupid reasons that I didn't think were ""my problem"". For example, I did some webinars with [Eatrightcpe.org](https://Eatrightcpe.org). The certificate of completion they generated at the end was uneditable  and missing information. I shrugged this off because since it's the academy who does the audits and the academy who I bought the CEUs from, shouldn't they know this info? Or at the very least, trust what I input into my log correctly or hell even double check it with theirs? Nope! Because *they* didn't fill it out right (ex. wrong amount of CEUs, no completion date, etc), I was denied credit for them. **SO, make sure if there is something wrong with your certificate of completion you have the provider correct it and get you a new one.**

I'm now considering going for my RD license, which means having to take the exam and internship if need be. My question is would I still need the internship? Or would my hospital experience serve as suitable alternative. Do I need a specific dietetic degree? Or will any BS of Nutrition do?

My college offered a dietetic path but I decided against it, only difference was a couple of senior level classes more geared toward hospital settings.

Since then I worked a bout 2.5 years in a hospital setting as a nutrition care coordinator, but ultimately left a couple of months ago.

I'm now considering going for my RD license, which means having to take the exam and internship if need be. My question is would I still need the internship? Or would my hospital experience serve as suitable alternative. Do I need a specific dietetic degree? Or will any BS of Nutrition do?

Can't tell if I'm just getting used to the American healthcare system or if I'm being pessimistic. Sorry for the rant y'all",2020-10-06 03:37:39
dietetics,"LTC Nutrition Activities Hi All!

Has anyone created nutrition activities for their nursing home? I’m thinking of things such as a “smoothie social”. Has anyone collaborated with the activities department to get more physical activity into the building for your residents? Would planning a group exercise class be out of our scope of practice? I would love any ideas for creative activities/snacks. I think it would be a big hit at my facility.

dietetics,"Advice for RD Feeling Incompetent Hello,

This is my first Reddit post ever, but I am looking for advice. 

I have been a dietitian for a little over a year now. I completed my internship and masters program last year (coordinated program).

Throughout the internship, I felt very incompetent and less knowledgeable than the other co-interns. Mind you, this internship was actual hell... We were in graduate school full time, working full time hours at the internship, and doing \~20hours of additional work per week for the internship outside of the workdays. Additionally, many of the preceptors did not like being preceptors and were some of the meanest people that I have ever encountered. 

Fast forward a year. I have a been a consultant RD working in LTC/sub-acute rehab and have gone to over 30 facilities in this time frame. I am a little more confident, but I still struggle with social anxiety, MNT recall, and feel like I am terrible at nutrition education, counseling, and building rapport with patients and other staff members. I also am worried that I am missing important interventions, etc., when it comes to the clinical aspect of things. Note, I am normally the only RD working at these facilities, completely responsible for managing my workload, and unable to ask more seasoned RDs for help or advice. 

When I talk to my other co-interns now, they are all very confident and feel competent as RDs. 

Is this normal? I feel that I should be more confident in my ability as a practitioner at this point. 

I'd love advice on how other RDs built their confidence, competence, and clinical/education/counseling skills.

My second exam was very well-rounded in all domains so I can't say I had more of one domain than others. There were a lot of sustainability questions that were surprising but easy at least.

All of my best friends tell me I should work in sports medicine or health and fitness.

At this very moment, the very idea of going to school to becoming a dietitian seems really cool. The only issue is that I have huge chunk of debt I have to pay.

I know in the US, it is possible to take graduate courses that prepare you for becoming a dietitian, but i'm not sure what it's like here in Canada.

So if there are any Canadian Dietitians reading this, could any of you offer me some advice?

I'd greatly appreciate it.",2020-09-28 07:08:34
dietetics,"Question regarding Food Science Jobs Hello,

I'm currently an Australian student, due to finish my Bachelors of Nutrition Science at the end of the year. I'm just wondering if it's possible to get into food science/tech with a Nutrition Degree? I thought that I wanted to go the Dietitian pathway, but now I'm feeling like I would enjoy the food science career more, ideally something like food product development.

If I can, I don't want to spend any more time and money on university, but I am open to doing a Masters in Food Science, or even going back and do an undergrad course in Food Science, if they're the only options. Also, there are some food science Graduate Diplomas that I've been looking at, that are a year long. Would they help me at all?

dietetics,"Any experience on Psychiatric medications and Low-Carbohydrates Nutrition Therapy? Hello people! I just saw a patient that has been following low carb with my guidance for several weeks now, but today things had a twist and I would like some guidance myself on what the next steps could be! 

She is 34, overweight, doesn´t have diabetes nor hypertension, and was diagnosed with depression more than 10 years ago. She started medication the first time she went to the Dr. which helped her manage her depression in the short term but made her gain 40 lb. This made her lose hope on anti-depression treatments, being this the main reason why she left the treatment and stopped seeing her Dr. After gaining weight it has been almost impossible for her to lose weight until she came with me and was able to lose her first pounds, -1% body fat and no muscle loss two weeks after our first session. 

It has been many years since she hadn´t visited a Dr, so she did saw a Psychiatrist last week that prescribed her Wellbutrin (Bupropion) 75 mg once per day and Clonazepam 1 mg once per day. The Dr told her she would experience less appetite and by her second week (this is this week) she is in fact experiencing less appetite. 

Our plan before visiting the Dr. was: 
1. 150 g CHO first week to learn carbohydrate counting, 130 g second week, 100 g third week, 100 g fourth week
2. 75 g of CHO after first month of decreasing carbs intake in 3 meals a day, 
3. Protein in each meal, 
4. Fats (specific sources) in each meal, 
5. Increase fat intake if she was feeling like having snacks between meals 
6. Vegetables as much as she wanted
7. Saturdays and Sundays she and her husband would not cook and they usually order food. She was ""aware"" of her carb sources and that helped her make better decisions when ordering food. I felt like this would help her see food with more ""freedom"" as she had had bad experiences with food before.

I’ve been trying to make her understand she doesn’t need to be skinny to be healthy. But the weight “issue” is hugely important for her. She states part of her depression comes from multiple factors, of course, but her weight is definitely one. Besides focusing on weight, I also like to focus on multiple nutrition education sessions. 

Now that she´s on her medical treatment:
1. Is there any specific nutrition information I need to know regarding this medication? 
2. Is there information with low carb eating and Bupropion?
3. Does anyone has had experience with this medication and low carb nutrition therapy before? 
4. Do you think keeping the 75 g CHO goal per day is still suitable?
5. Are there specific steps you would take from this point to generate good results and/or optimize nutrition?

dietetics,"Nutritionist working at WIC: Advice Hi all - Was hoping to get possible advice on how to approach a rapidly deteriorating situation at my current place of work:

I’m a male military veteran who used my GI Bill to go back to school for a B.S. in health sciences - What I saw as a “stepping stone” degree to higher education in the healthcare field. I’m currently working in the WIC program which is a little outside of what I was looking for, but is not bad as my first job out of college. The only problem is, all of my coworkers and teammates at WIC are women - No problem with this, but I just feel completely ostracized and out of place at work everyday although I’ve tried to the best of my ability to be social and friendly with everyone. And because of the rampant gossip I hear about other coworkers behind their backs, I know that I’m being gossiped about &amp; talked about behind my back as well. Furthermore, I’ve done the best I can at this job with the tools and knowledge I’ve been given but there has been little to no job training done outside of computer-based powerpoint training and it seems that you’re not appreciated for what you do correct and do well, but heavily chastised when you make a mistake - Many times on things I’ve never been taught in the first place. 

Alongside this, it seems that my boss is playing favoritism with a new girl that was hired a few months after me - Praising her, giving her a position above me as community outreach coordinator and internship coordinator in front of me (idk if this was to try and motivate me or maybe demean me in some way..??) The new girl was even given her employee orientation before me - To date, I’ve worked for WIC for 5 months now and never received a proper employee orientation. I just can’t hell but feel that everyone else is being held to a different set of standards and rules than I am. It’s making me absolutely miserable at work all day every day - sick to my stomach most days. Sunday nights are the worst and I begin getting anxious, depressed and nauseous. Just today (9/21/20) I was running a little behind and came in at the same time as new girl, nobody said anything to new girl but I was asked for a reason as to why I was late this morning and before leaving for home at the end of the night, my boss said she had to do a review with me tomorrow (I’m assuming it will be pertaining to my being late this morning). 

Sorry for the long post, was just hoping somebody could offer some insight or advice to my situation. Anything is appreciated - Positive, negative, etc. 

TL;DR: Male working at WIC, completely out of place and miserable due to lack of communication, training, gossip and favoritism to the point of being nauseous at work everyday, wondering what my options are for other jobs requiring a bachelor’s in the healthcare field.",Nutritionist working at WIC: Advice,"Hi all - Was hoping to get possible advice on how to approach a rapidly deteriorating situation at my current place of work:

I’m a male military veteran who used my GI Bill to go back to school for a B.S. in health sciences - What I saw as a “stepping stone” degree to higher education in the healthcare field. I’m currently working in the WIC program which is a little outside of what I was looking for, but is not bad as my first job out of college. The only problem is, all of my coworkers and teammates at WIC are women - No problem with this, but I just feel completely ostracized and out of place at work everyday although I’ve tried to the best of my ability to be social and friendly with everyone. And because of the rampant gossip I hear about other coworkers behind their backs, I know that I’m being gossiped about &amp; talked about behind my back as well. Furthermore, I’ve done the best I can at this job with the tools and knowledge I’ve been given but there has been little to no job training done outside of computer-based powerpoint training and it seems that you’re not appreciated for what you do correct and do well, but heavily chastised when you make a mistake - Many times on things I’ve never been taught in the first place. 

Alongside this, it seems that my boss is playing favoritism with a new girl that was hired a few months after me - Praising her, giving her a position above me as community outreach coordinator and internship coordinator in front of me (idk if this was to try and motivate me or maybe demean me in some way..??) The new girl was even given her employee orientation before me - To date, I’ve worked for WIC for 5 months now and never received a proper employee orientation. I just can’t hell but feel that everyone else is being held to a different set of standards and rules than I am. It’s making me absolutely miserable at work all day every day - sick to my stomach most days. Sunday nights are the worst and I begin getting anxious, depressed and nauseous. Just today (9/21/20) I was running a little behind and came in at the same time as new girl, nobody said anything to new girl but I was asked for a reason as to why I was late this morning and before leaving for home at the end of the night, my boss said she had to do a review with me tomorrow (I’m assuming it will be pertaining to my being late this morning).

dietetics,"I’m DONE I can’t do this anymore. 😡😪😤

No matter what I do, it’s not good enough for employers. Here’s a timeline of my nutrition/dietetics career since graduating a few years back. 

-Diet Tech at rehab/LTC for about 2 years
-Distance DI (ISPP)-couldn’t find preceptors to cover some rotations and found it unsupportive on many levels-dismissed from internship. Got in way of my work. Was devastated, but over it now.
-Diet Tech at rehab hospital for almost 2 months-let go for not improving numbers (menus collected) when  there was no structure in place, making it nearly impossible to do this efficiently and get all my work done on time. My coworkers took shortcuts just to get out on time. 

~Didn’t work for a bit because of the madness that occurred while interviewing for new DTR jobs.~

-Diet Tech/Consultant in LTC facilities-Dismissed less than a week ago after 1 week for not completing enough assessments. Yes, 1 week. I moved across the country for this position. I didn’t even get the time to prove myself. Was working remotely on PCC, learning and applying my company’s charting standards, learning the policies of the facilities I was assigned to and taking on more high risk patients all at once. I never met these residents and hadn’t stepped foot in the facilities. Despite these limitations, I just wanted to do a good job and I have done this before. 

RANT: F**K this industry. SO much work out in, yet all I get is BULLSH*T. We are told to go out of comfort zones if we want to be successful RDs and be more creditable, but how the F am I supposed to when this keeps happening?!?

to have a high calorie, high protein diet and to have 5-6 small meals throughout the day to decrease feelings of fatigue. For nutrition counseling, I recommend the patient to have education on meal prepping so when it comes to meal times, the patient is not too tired to eat.

dietetics,"Passed RD Exam! + Tips! Hey everyone!

Super happy to say that I have passed my RD exam today! Exactly 45 days ago I sat for my first attempt at the exam and unfortunately failed. I was extremely upset and down on myself. All this hard work to get to this spot and to fail at one little test? Well I'm here to tell you what changes I made in my studying habits that helped improve my score enough to pass and general test taking tips.

Firstly, I purchased the 2020 Inman review. This was the most helpful resource for me personally to learn all of the content on the exam. I went through once domain by domain listening to the audio and highlighting the info wherever she said 'note'. Then I would read each section by myself out loud to help the information sink in better. After going through one of the domains, I would take the practice questions associated with it. I would self-grade myself and note the pages where I could find the answer to those questions. Now let me tell you, this took FOREVER, but was super helpful in my studying process.

I also made note cards on particular topics that I thought I would need a little extra attention/memorization. I did these for the diabetic exchanges/food borne illness/ and governmental programs. I would flip through these everyday and by the end, I knew them all.

Another resource that I used heavily was MedicalPrep (previously called PocketPrep). I bought the one month subscription that gave you access to 650 questions. I went through all of the questions after I took a deep dive in Inman. What I loved about this app was the explanations. Not only would it tell you the correct answer, but it would explain why none of the other options are correct. This helped me reason with each question to make sure I was choosing the 'best' answer. I also found that this app had questions and answers most closely sounding to the actual exam from what I remembered the first time around.

A huge struggle for me for the first exam was answering the subjective type questions. If it is related to content/knowledge at least that is something I can memorize. With the subjective, you have to use your critical thinking skills to choose the BEST answer. Note that all of the answers are feasible, but they range from okay to good to better to best. What I did to tackle my weakness here was Kimberly Kramer's One and Done situational class. Here she taught a method to help break the question down to determine the best answer. I won't get into the specifics as this is her credibility, but I can assure you it was amazing. This honestly helped me greatly because now at least I wasn't taking a shot in the dark, but taking an educated guess. (FYI: she also offers a ton of other classes for every domain and helps teach mnemonics for the info to stick).

Now that I've done all the prep, its time for exam day. Before starting the exam, I wrote my name at the top of my whiteboard, followed by 'RD'. Seeing is believing people. This time around I found the exam to be a lot more straight-forward. Was that because my questions were more simple or because I now knew the information better? Maybe a combination of both. This time I really took my time with the questions. I would write key words for each question on the white board to slow myself down and process what was really being asked of me. All of the effort proved successful when I submitted my last question, filled out the survey and saw 'congratulations' appear on the screen. I can't tell you the wave of relief that flushed over me.

I hope that this is something that you all can use as motivation and advice as you embark on your RD exam. I found this subreddit to be really helpful in my study time so hopefully I can pay it forward now.

Thank you all so much,

Sincerely a newly minted RD

I recently finished an internship back in June and took some summer classes at a local university to finish up my masters degree. I began applying for jobs around July/August. I had an interview in a city about 500 miles from my home. They flew me out there for the interview and paid for my place to stay. I was really nervous about it but it went well. I came home and had another interview at a local hospital. A few days later was called about the job I had interviewed away from home and I ended up accepting the offer.

The job is a multi-site position as a clinical dietitian in long term and acute care. I did have some experience in my internship in acute care but it was minimal. I already scheduled to take my RD exam in October after I move because moving and packing has been a bit stressful and it was hard for me to study at home while so much is going on.

All being said, I am SO excited to finally have my dream job but I want to prepare myself for acute and long term care environments. What kinds of things should I brush up on in terms of nutrition knowledge? Does anybody have any advice for how to prepare walking into my first job and things I should know? What did you find was helpful for you when you first started?

I had an interview in a city about 500 miles from my home. They flew me out there for the interview and paid for my place to stay. I was really nervous about it but it went well. I came home and had another interview at a local hospital. A few days later was called about the job I had interviewed away from home and I ended up accepting the offer.

The job is a multi-site position as a clinical dietitian in long term and acute care. I did have some experience in my internship in acute care but it was minimal. I already scheduled to take my RD exam in October after I move because moving and packing has been a bit stressful and it was hard for me to study at home while so much is going on.

All being said, I am SO excited to finally have my dream job but I want to prepare myself for acute and long term care environments. What kinds of things should I brush up on in terms of nutrition knowledge? Does anybody have any advice for how to prepare walking into my first job and things I should know? What did you find was helpful for you when you first started?

I appreciate any feedback or advice! Thank you so much!",2020-09-19 22:46:29

I have a resident at my facility who is morbidly obese, who came here for rehab to use a walker again after a fall. This information is important to remember.

Her family decided a few months in that they wanted her to be long term, and she was taken off of rehab, essentially keeping her mostly wheelchair bound. She continued to gain some weight, but not much considering the circumstances. 

Recently the owner of our facility has come back and decided to actually run the place instead of just own it, and he's seems to have it out for this resident. He usually refers to her by her weight, and since she's come back from a recent hospital visit he constantly mentions her exact weight since it was taken upon readmission. Today she fell trying to transfer herself from her wheelchair to her bed, and the education intervention that our owner suggested was telling her that she can't transfer herself because she's xxx pounds. Not because she has obesity, but because of weakness to her legs, but because of her exact weight. He and the DON treat her weight as a severe disability although she is currently weight bearing on both legs and was walking with a walker prior to initial admission.

In short- I hate my current job responsibilities (I work in a public health nutrition setting). I find them unchallenging and it is seriously killing my motivation.

My workplace also has an efficiency and organization problem that makes simple things so frustrating to get through. Mildly productive 2+ hour long meetings are the norm because my supervisor won't make agendas (I've asked several times).  In meetings, I've sat back and listened as my supervisor and coworker argued for 30+ minutes about what portion size of vegetables to approve for menus- twice. I was technically never actually trained on how to do my job- just given about 20 documents to read through. My boss frequently stated that ""before going virtual, we would usually show you how to do this in person"". Why not just show me virtually??

I have one foot out the door and I just started 4 months ago.

New ideas that I suggest get sent to ""I'll think about it"" oblivion. We usually just end up doing what the supervisor wanted to do in the first place. Former employees have told me this was par for the course.

I have plans to further my education (public health research or medicine). My hope was that this job would give me ground level public health experience as well some higher level technical skills, like grant writing and teaching, that would align with future goals. Thus far, it hasn't, but to be fair I have not communicated my goals to my boss.

**So my question is- how do I ask my change adverse boss for different job responsibilities that better align with my future goals?**

**TLDR: I hate my job responsibilities and need to know how to ask my change-adverse boss for new ones that align with my future goals. This is my first full time job, and I am confrontation adverse.**",Unchallenged at work-4 months in and I have one foot out the door,"**This will partially be venting, but I also really do need advice.**

dietetics,"Why are Triglycerides considered the most abundant lipid in the body and NOT Phospholipids? In multiple classes now I have heard the professor say that Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid in the body (or something along those lines). If asked what is the most abundant lipid in the body, my first instinct would be to say phospholipids, since they are in the cell membrane and organelles of every cell in the body, right? So how could triglycerides be more abundant? Are they comparing numbers of molecules, mass of the molecules, or volume of the molecules? Are there really that many triglyceride molecules in the body compared to phospholipids?...

If anyone could explain, I would greatly appreciate it.

Lately, I can’t seem to get out of thinking that I chose the wrong career path - mainly, because I keep remembering all the issues that come with becoming an RD (lack of diversity, financial hardships, AND sponsored by big pharma and fast food chains, constant reinforcement throughout our education that clinical dietetics is superior, low pay, lack of respect - just to name a few). I’ve lost the spark and passion I had in this field over a year ago. I can’t help but feel disdain whenever I open up a nutrition textbook or listen to a nutrition lecture. 

I’m in my DI now and the anxiety has only heightened to another degree. Not only do I suffer with a severe case of imposter syndrome and have no interest in clinical work which I feel is being pushed onto me, I am upset with the lack of organization and structure from my program. I feel bombarded with assignments that were assigned without warning. There was no thorough communication being made at all prior to the start of this. The entire process was unreasonably expensive and would’ve been impossible without financial support from family, but I’m not finding the internship to be even remotely reflective of its price tag and the costs associated with starting the program. 

I know I need to push through this year and look at it in the grand scheme of things, but it’s difficult when each passing day just feels meaningless because I am forced to do work I have no interest in doing. First off, I am aware I should seek therapy to help with this situation, but I feel overwhelmed with the program to even incorporate a weekly session into my schedule.

dietetics,"Questions about being an RD at a boutique fitness studio Hi everyone! A fitness studio approached me about offering nutrition services at their studio. They have never offered anything like this before. They currently have one membership tier which is $85-$110 depending on if you’re a student or not. They’re going to offer a premium membership where clients in this tier will have the chance to meet with the RD twice a month for 20 mins as the added benefit.

They don’t have a set budget or anything but one of their current clients name dropped me and so I’m the first RD they’ve reached out to. This is also a direction I’ve been really interested in going in. How do I go about pricing this out? They’re looking to pay me per session per client. I’m getting clients because of them so obviously it would be less than what I would charge in my own practice.

I've become aware through this sub and elsewhere that the dietetic internship is a big hurdle to get over in the process of becoming an RD - specifically, due to the cost and competitiveness/availability of internships.

Currently, I have not yet been admitted to a dietetics program (I'm working on my last couple of prereqs).

Of course, I don't want to accrue a lot of debt from the internship on top of my debt from tuition. I also don't want to have to move in order to complete the internship, as having to pay rent while interning would immensely complicate things and might not be possible. 

What would I need to do now to be one of the fortunate students who is able to get a local, affordable internship?

dietetics,"Request for career advice (currently majoring in dietetics) Hi, I'm currently pursuing a BS in dietetics and recently started  considering other health-related career paths. I would really appreciate  some advice on which would be best for me, given the context. My  primary reason for wanting to major in nutrition is that the path  involves gaining a solid understanding of basic science and how the body works. I'm also very interested in how diet can enhance one's health over the long term and prevent disease, and I enjoy gaining knowledge  that I can apply to my own life to live more healthily. At the moment at  least, this is the main motivator for my pursuits, as opposed to being  dead set on becoming a nutrition counselor, for example. As of now and the past few years, I mainly gravitate toward nutrition because I want to understand.

I've read some posts on this sub that suggests going the RD track is often not worth the time, energy, and tuition. Money, while not the only thing that's important to me, is important to me. So is upward  mobility. I'm reconsidering pursuing the RD track because I'm concerned  it wouldn't allow me to earn a high income that can grow over time and  to constantly be learning new things about how the body works and how to  be healthy. I'm aware that there are different things an RD can do with their degree, so maybe I don't need to be concerned about these  particular things. 

I would also rather continue to further my own understanding than coach people on eating better. I think I'm more interested in the nuances of nutrition than educating others about the basics. 

Some of the plans I've been considering are: 1) major in nutrition science (not dietetics) and become a nutrition researcher, 2) major in nutrition science and become a PA, or 3) pursue nursing but focus on  nutrition specifically, if that's possible. I'm also considering just getting the dietetics degree/license just to leave open the option to work as a dietitian in some capacity.

As a side note, I haven't shadowed any of these professions yet. I'm not sure how I could since I'm under the impression doing so would violate a patient's privacy.

I really didn't consider nursing until now, and I'd only pursue it if I  could delve into nutrition later on. I began to consider it and the PA route because the pay and job availability/security are better (from what I've read), and it seems to be a more open-ended career, which could be helpful for me since I'm not set on a specific job right now. However, some of the aspect of nursing  that don't appeal to me are the long hours (I'd rather work a 9 to 5  and I value work-life balance) and the fact that it doesn't seem to involve much prevention of health issues.

I don't yet know much about how I would become a nutrition research scientist, but it appeals to me because it would involve constantly gaining new understandings about how food works in the body (have any RDs or nutrition science majors here gone on to be nutrition researchers, by the way?). 

Being a PA seems more desirable to me than being a nurse in the sense that it seems more low-key and less inconsistent in terms of the hours/work schedule, but I could be  wrong as I've only met PAs in doctors' offices as a patient.

Some of the plans I've been considering are: 1) major in nutrition science (not dietetics) and become a nutrition researcher, 2) major in nutrition science and become a PA, or 3) pursue nursing but focus on  nutrition specifically, if that's possible. I'm also considering just getting the dietetics degree/license just to leave open the option to work as a dietitian in some capacity.

As a side note, I haven't shadowed any of these professions yet. I'm not sure how I could since I'm under the impression doing so would violate a patient's privacy.

I really didn't consider nursing until now, and I'd only pursue it if I  could delve into nutrition later on. I began to consider it and the PA route because the pay and job availability/security are better (from what I've read), and it seems to be a more open-ended career, which could be helpful for me since I'm not set on a specific job right now. However, some of the aspect of nursing  that don't appeal to me are the long hours (I'd rather work a 9 to 5  and I value work-life balance) and the fact that it doesn't seem to involve much prevention of health issues.

I don't yet know much about how I would become a nutrition research scientist, but it appeals to me because it would involve constantly gaining new understandings about how food works in the body (have any RDs or nutrition science majors here gone on to be nutrition researchers, by the way?). 

Being a PA seems more desirable to me than being a nurse in the sense that it seems more low-key and less inconsistent in terms of the hours/work schedule, but I could be  wrong as I've only met PAs in doctors' offices as a patient. 

Which path would you guys advise me to go down?",2020-09-11 06:55:33

Okay so I want to do the JET Program which is a program in Japan where you teach English to students and the program also pays for your living expenses and they also pay you a stipend each month.... I know it has nothing to do with nutrition but I’ve always wanted to go to Japan and why not go to Japan and get also get paid to explore the country?? I’m currently a senior and I’m 21 years old and I only plan to do the JET program for a year so yeah....

My question is should I do the jet program for a year once I graduate and then do my internship or should I do the internship and then do the jet program for a year? The problem is a lot of people are known to get rejected when they apply for the JET program if they are overqualified, for example if you are a registered nurse, doctor, hold a masters degree, doctorates degree etc etc so I think that applies or if you are a registered dietitian because once I do my internship Im going to take the rd test..... 

Also the JET program is more catered to young adults like me who just graduated college. I do want to be a dietitian but hey I also want to do this while I’m young. I was also thinking that if I do end up doing the JET Program in Japan before the I do my internship I can still probably shadow some dietitians/nutritionists in Japan as a side thing so I’ll be able to gain some extra clinical experience.

dietetics,"Preparing for 3rd RD exam attempt - can't get a job I graduated from my dietetic internship in the summer of 2019, and I have attempted the CDR exam twice - once right after my internship and once in January. I have another attempt scheduled for mid-October. I am living with my fiance, who pays all of our bills. I was laid off from my part-time daycare job in March. My unemployment benefits are very *very* limited, and go towards the credit card debt I accumulated putting myself through my DI. I haven't been able to find a job since then, and I really need to start bringing in some money soon. I'll be off my parents' health insurance in May, and my fiance doesn't have health insurance that I am able to get on. 

In short, I'm feeling discouraged, frustrated, and hopeless. I'm studying for several hours each day, but even if I pass the exam, I'm not convinced that I'll be able to find a job in this field. I look daily for jobs in Extension, with WIC and SNAP, and as a dietary technician, but the market in my state is oversaturated. I worked briefly as a restaurant manager last winter, but six years of foodservice jobs through undergrad and afterwards ate away at my soul.

I get to be on the cutting edge of technology for diabetes management and working directly with 3 endocrinologists. The endos really respect me which has taken a couple years to build up.

She is quite large so she already has high baseline requirements and on top of it has cellulitis which isn’t healing well and newly diagnosed metastatic cancer which would push the requirements up even more.

As an dietetic intern, I was used to my preceptor introducing me to everyone or speaking up for me. As a new dietitian, I know I have to be pro-active and do it myself. 

What is the best way to get myself known to the interdisciplinary team? Should I introduce myself individually to each person or announce it to the entire group during rounds? Since I am per diem, I won’t be there as often so should I keep introducing myself if I’m not there all the time? I don’t expect them to remember my name (hopefully eventually they will) but I also don’t want to be standing during rounds while everyone is wondering who I am. I would love to know everyone’s experiences. 

Any advice is appreciated!",2020-09-03 23:26:43

dietetics,"Typical Salary/Benefits - Diet Tech and RD What is the average salary for a diet tech, and a registered dietitian? I live in CA for reference. I'm also interested in the benefits (401K, how much vaca time per year). I am interested in pursuing this career but due to these unique times I likely cannot job shadow anyone. If anyone would be open to inboxing me and allowing me to ask them some questions I'd really appreciate it!

Also, I know the internships (and then getting the RD job eventually) are incredibly competitive. I heard on a thread somewhere that you usually need to have some sort of clinical or hospital experience or you may not get an internship. Is this true?

For reference, I have a B.S. in Psychology, a B.A. in Anthropology, 3 years of home care experience working with elderly individuals with disabilities, and 3 years experience working for a medical software company for hospitals, supporting pharmacists. So I have working experience, and one of them was in a corporate setting but I don't know if this would look good or be compatible/related.

I'm assuming that many people become a diet tech first and then eventually an RD if wanting to be in clinical - is this the 'normal' path?

Also, I'm considering starting online courses through Kansas State or Alabama State (both are accredited). Is doing courses online frowned upon in this field? Would you recommend doing some online courses for the B.S. but then doing the last year of it in-person for networking purposes etc? I'm trying to save money and online seems to be the way to go but I don't want to miss out on anything that may help me get an internship/network.

dietetics,"Help in changing my current diet I need some advice to tweak my current diet to achieve the outcome I'm looking for. I'd appreciate anyone's help on the matter.

I'm Male, 22, 178cm, 64kg who is moderately active. I run 2km down to my local park and back 5 days a week and do moderate weight training 4-5 days a week. Other than that I sit at a desk most of the time as that is my job. I'm borderline skinny, but I have stubborn fat around my belly like everyone does. What I'm looking for is to drop that belly fat so I can look more defined and also build muscle mass. I'm not looking to get super ripped, but toned enough to show that I'm in decent shape more than anything. 

I eat pretty much the same thing every day, this is my current diet:

Breakfast: Oats, 1 Banana or 1 Apple (or half of each), Ground Cinnamon and a splash of Full Cream Milk

Lunch: 3 Eggs, 1 Wholemeal Toast spread with 1/4 of an Avocado. 

Dinner: 1 cup of Brown Rice, roughly 70g of Mixed Frozen Vegetables (Peas, Carrots and Corn), 3 Fish Fingers (Birds Eye) and a tablespoon of Sweet Chilli Sauce

Snacks: Can of Tuna, Protein Shake (Vital Strength), maybe some Yoghurt and Fruit or Toast.

Currently this equals to around 6000 Kilojoules, 75g Protein, 140g Carbs, 20g Fibre, 38g Sugar, 42g Fat. This would be fine if I was trying to do a calorie deficit, but not too sure if that's good if I also want to build muscle as there is not a lot of protein. Personally I think I should be focusing more on building mass more than losing weight, but I'm not too sure. I've been doing this meal plan for 1 month, I've dropped 1Kg, and look a little more defined. Can anyone help me on improving this? I know what I'm doing for weight training determines a lot of things, but I'd like to get my diet right first, as I feel that's more important starting off. I'd like to add chicken into this diet too, maybe get a 4th meal out of it. I don't really like to snack as I'd prefer larger meals to feel fuller for longer. Any advice is appreciated.

But I'm afraid it might be too late to go ahead and rush the schooling.

I know it's going to be difficult but it's the one thing I've been wanting to major in/do for YEARS. And if I can't do it by 2024, that's ok because I'm still going to do it, but I'd prefer to have the job before I go back to school for a second degree.

I’m going to a dietician in 2 weeks and want to prepare as best I can. What questions should I ask? How should I prepare? What resources should I look at?

*background on me*
- epilepsy (diagnoses in Dec 13, it was under control with the help of keto - fat heavy diet, prior to Nov )
- Crohn’s disease (diagnosed in Nov ‘19, moved away from Keto to leaner diet to try manage Crohns naturally. My seizures relapsed, Crohns got worse and now I’m on steroids to try manage the Crohns)
- Mental illnesses (PTSD, NEAD, BPD - none of which are relevant, except the borderline as it caused 10 years of disordered eating and purging / binging behaviours)

Which is super fun. The epilepsy / Crohns combo seems to be the biggest issue as the diet that helps my epilepsy has really negatively impacted my Crohns and the diet that is supposed to help my Crohns, triggers my epilepsy.

Would love any advice on how I can prepare and educate myself ahead of my first appointment with my dietician.

RD of 4 years this October. The last two years I have practiced as a Lead RD over several states - I was involved in the hiring of RDs in the LTC setting across many states and have see a wide variety of salaries, many of which seemed incredibly low for experienced RDs with their MS. 

For reference - recently changed positions to work as a renal RD and was surprised to learn I would make more than my management position aforementioned. 

I want us all to have an open and honest discuss regarding pay so that new RDs can have realistic expectations and that we all feel comfortable asking for what we’re worth. 

Here’s the low down of some of my jobs and their respective pay (I also have my MS in dietetics): 

$30/hr LTC PRN (KY) brand new RD 
(When I started they paid $26/hr but I found out from other RDs that PRN make more typically so I requested an accurate pay scale of $30/hr and they adjusted it.)

Hospital outpatient/behavioral clinic $28/hr (KY) FT - first job (great benefits package so accepted a lower range than I ideally wanted)

LTC RD - $30/hr (WA) FT

Promoted to Lead RD - $34.25/hr (WA) FT
(When I took the promotion they stuck me at $31/hr while I trained, within 8mo I was practicing at a much higher level and requested a raise to $35 and they countered with $34.25.. I took it.)
 
Newly accepted position: Renal RD - $35.50/hr (WA) FT (they consider me ‘inexperienced’ in renal &lt;to be experienced you have to have worked in a dialysis clinic before&gt; and they would not go higher after I was offered a matched salary and $5000 signing bonus by another company.. still liked this job better so trusted my gut and stuck with it.) 

Anyway, I’m just curious what other people are making and their experiences fighting for better pay. There have been many job offers in between that I’ve had to decline simply because their pay scale was so far off from what I expect RDs to make. A few of the recruiters had mentioned that the RDs in their company as a whole didn’t make what I was requesting so they would not be able to meet my salary needs - have you seen or heard this?

Last month I applied to a prn clinical rd position that listed “1 year acute exp preferred”. Recruiter contacted me to let me know that she would send my app to the hiring manager, but it was unlikely I would be considered without the experience. I completed a strong clinical internship in the same area and have good references from my clinical rotation and internship director, so I was hoping that I could land a interview. Unfortunately, I get the rejection email within the next few days. 

I noticed on LinkedIn that they reposted the same job position. I go onto the company website and it looks like they didn’t fill the same position I applied to.

dietetics,"5 Ways To Manage Your Diet For Diabetes Since my diagnosis with diabetes at the age of eleven, my own diet has changed dramatically.  I maintain my current healthy weight with a great diet/eating plan. If you do plan on losing more than about a stone in weight then I would visit your doctor for more tips on how to do this without risk.  

I've had diabetes for seven years now, but to tell you that how I maintain weight is perfect would be totally wrong of me.  However, I can advise you to follow my steps because I know what works and what doesn't. Before I really begin I must also say that I have been brought up by great parents who taught me to eat everything, and so I do! If there is something that you don't like, there are loads of other diabetic recipes and ideas that you will eat and appreciate.

I am a university student, and I like to buy fresh and organic produce from where I live. I believe that this is important because it can be the best for your body and contain more nutrients and vitamins than most supermarket produce. I like to source food from my fortnightly farmers market in town, which sells amazing meat and dairy produce and fresh in-season fruit and vegetables. Another important thing to remember is eating fruit and vegetables in their season means that they will taste better as well as doing you good. I have a lot of influence from Western European cuisine (mainly France and Italy) as you will tell, but I do not profess to be a chef, and everything is easy to make and very convenient.

I have read countless diet books and diabetic recipe/diet books, and I came to the conclusion that I think really works. I fused all the good things from the diets (but not from every diet) and sort of put together my own one. I call this my Juvenile Diabetes Healthy Diet!

dietetics,"Have you ever experienced religious discrimination in the workplace? Mods! If this is not allowed please take it down!

I am a dietetic intern in their food service management rotation. I am thrilled that I am one of the few students who has gotten placed. However, I feel as if I have experienced belief discrimination throughout my course at this site. For reference, I am at a Christian-based hospital and I am non-Christian.

Almost every meeting I have attended, the last five minutes end with a bible verse or follow with a prayer. I cannot help but notice that every computer lock screen has a bible verse on it and every tray sent up to patients also has a bible verse. The water cooler chat here was not how the weather was but was how the Sunday church service was. If anyone is to play music in the office, it was going to be Christian music. 

I feel like I am being disrespectful if I say no to prayer because I simply do not share the same belief. I try to be courteous by putting my head down when they say a prayer. I feel disregarded because the staff (food service director, executive chef, etc.) assumes my religious beliefs. I understand having a chapel in the hospital, so patients and their families can gather there when they may be going through the grieving   process. However, it seems disrespectful to bring this into employee meetings. Not only do I feel uncomfortable throughout this entire supervised practice experience, but I felt like I was being shamed for not practicing Christianity. 

The entire time I felt lost because I did not know who to turn to about this. The Food Service Director and all other team leaders follow this behavior. I sat down with the Food Service Director after one of the meetings where she shares a prayer, and she said to me “I’m so glad I can do this” I replied with “do what?” and she said “share my messages and talk about my religion. I can tell which employees are fond of it and which are not.” I just stood there in silence out of the excruciating discomfort I had experienced. Did she know that I was not one of the staff members that was a non-Christian? What if I had admitted that I feel awkward? I want to emphasize that I have nothing wrong with other religions. I believe everyone has a right to religious freedom and to practice his/her own religion and faith – but to bring it into the workplace felt like a form of religious discrimination. I have volunteered at other hospitals that also have some religious affiliation, but have never experienced this. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Is this normal for a hospital setting? Should I just stay quiet?

dietetics,"Thoughts on ""Dietitian Side-Hustle Make a 6-Figure Salary Business Coaches""? I've gotten several messages from these kinds of folks in the past. I won't name names because I'm sure others have seen and know what I mean and if I'm just not thinking about this in the right way, I don't want to shame anyone.

I have generally always engaged with them in a friendly way and hear what they have to say or what they think they have to offer me, especially because I have always dreamed of starting my own business, but I just don't know what to think. They make big promises like ""I'll teach you my proven method to turn your salary into 6-figures"" or ""attract 10x the clients overnight!"" or my favorite ""Let me tell you how I made 25k in 1 month even while being a full-time mom"" (all kinds of problematic things with that from my POV). They also seem to trigger my strong emotions a lot with things like: ""are you tired of working in an underpaid clinical job in a basement in the bad part of town?"" and then trying to build really fast trust with ""I used to be just like you, I know exactly how you are feeling"" or ""I never imagine I would have this much success"". 

Anyways, they always loop me in with their sophisticated pitches and beautiful websites/blogs/Instagrams, but then they come out that their program costs $4000-6000 dollars. Sometimes it all feels like a more sophisticated MLM scheme because it seems like it would enrich the coach more than the client. Like you're more likely you would make a 6-figure salary by selling these expensive ""groups/programs/masterclasses"" about how to build a business than you ever would actually building a private practice.

Anyways, just wondering what others thoughts are on this? Do my intuitions seem valid? I have wondered if getting a coach would get me closer to actually starting the kind of business I dream of creating, but my gut is also telling me that these things are not legit or underpromising at best.","Thoughts on ""Dietitian Side-Hustle Make a 6-Figure Salary Business Coaches""?","I've gotten several messages from these kinds of folks in the past.

dietetics,"Failed RD Exaxm  Hey everyone,

Looking for general advice and/or just to rant. So today I took the RD exam for the first time and failed with a score of 22. My main resource was eatrightprep that I went through entirely two times over. I seriously studied for 2 weeks for about 8 hours each day. I was averaging in the low to high 70s for the practice exams, which I read would be consistent with a passing score on the exam. I also had old Inman audios that I used to supplement eatrightprep.

It's just frustrating because I felt prepared going into the exam only to have the questions seem 100 times more difficult on the screen. They were mostly application-based that had more than one right answer. I read through each question twice over to make sure I understood what was asked of me. Any tips for answering those application-type questions. Content-wise I feel confident, but when its those subjective questions like 'which would be the first step', I got tripped up. I seemed to do pretty okay on those types of questions for eatrightprep, but not so much on the actual exam. Perhaps I was just so stressed.

So to ensure I pass at my second go around, I just bought the updated inman review to allow for more test questions and overall exam day tips. Also does anyone have any advice for how I can continue to review eatrightprep?

Overall it's just upsetting to not pass because I've been working up to this moment for so long. It feels as though getting a job and finally becoming a dietitian keeps getting pushed back. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

So I love nutrition/dietetics however the low pay/lack of respect is making me really discouraged. I understand that the amount of respect you get and your privileges as an RD will largely depend on where you work. However, I have heard from almost every RD that they don’t make much and as someone who made a poor choice in undergrad and is now in a lot of debt, I am nervous about the low pay, especially if I may have to get my masters in the future.

I also understand most of the money is in food service, however I do not think I would enjoy that. I would prefer to work with eating disorder patients or in an outpatient center working with PKU and other metabolic disorders. 

Long story short, has anyone been able to pay off a lot of loans and feel that dietetics has paid enough to do so with relatively low stress and/or what are some high paying dietetic jobs that people have that aren’t in the food service sector.

I've come to a dead end trying to find work in the nutrition field that pays more than $12/hour. Since I'm potentially moving in with my mom due to COVID, I figured it'd be a great time to get serious about getting my licensure.

I had my heart set on getting an in-state DI, but am now looking at distance options. I've found a few programs that I'd likely get accepted into, but I'm concerned about the overall cost of the program (tuition, cost of living, health insurance, etc).

I have a patient that has had MANY recurrent issues with blockages. Patient has ileostomy from Crohns. Has had reconstruction surgery x3 now in the past 2 years.  She stayed on liquids post this recent surgery.  Just recently hospitalized again for SBO. Had NG tube placed.

Now afraid to eat absolutely anything. I’ve encouraged her to eat one new approved food for a few days to monitor output/symptoms, as well as in small portions. Have already discussed Importance of adequate hydration. Poor girl is very anxious and afraid to slowly introduce foods. Most recent surgery was May 2020.

Being an Optometrist does tick those things as I do help people out with their eyesight, however I haven't enjoyed this job in a long time. I realised I only picked this job to please my parents and because it looked comfortable (9 to 5, social time etc.) but I have no passion/interest for it. Whereas Nutrition is something I read for fun till late hours, whether it be doing courses (which I have done), reading forums, experimenting with myself and my own nutrition/fitness. So I thought why not try something that I enjoy whilst helping those that are more vulnerable than me in this game of life without regretting not ever doing it?

So I am researching this career properly before I make a sure commitment and one question I wanted to ask is: what is a typical patient routine like? Is it a lot of talking/consulting? Or is it a lot of testing? How long does it take to deal with the average patient? If I could get a breakdown of a typical patient routine that would be great. For example as an Optometrist my routine is: 1) Take a case history of symptoms 2) Check the health of their eyes with appropriate equipment 3) check ocular motor skills 4) refract to get a reading of their eyesight.

1. How do you determine if they are elevated because of dehydration or because the patient actually has a renal insufficiency. I would usually look at BUN/Cr ratio. I read that if it’s &gt;20 it’s usually pre renal.

I have been browsing this sub for quite awhile now and it has helped me a lot, thank you.

I know this is a long journey, especially considering a graduate degree will be required as of 2024, so I know I have a 6ish year path ahead of me, but it's what I want to do more than anything.

My reason for my post is this simple question:
What advice would you give yourself if you were in my position again as a new student? Is there anything that I should be preparing for or do that would give me an advantage on what I know will be a long tough journey?

During my dietetic internship, my preceptor at a GI focused outpatient clinic frequently had to ""clear up"" information that was given by the patient's chiropractor. The worst case I saw was a mother of a young child was prepping her son for endoscopy test for Celiac disease. When she told her chiropractor about it, he began telling her all about how it could be because he is eating too many pesticides. Thankfully, she was skeptical and adopted a gluten free diet for her son after the test came back positive. Still, I often think about how damaging that could have been.

This surprised me enough that I did a bit of digging, chiros have no evidenced based practice requirements, receive minimal education compared to physicians, and are truly only useful in a narrow scope of practice.

But what if there no iron panel? I wouldn’t be comfortable recommending an iron supplement if I didn’t know it *was* iron deficiency anemia. I know IDA is the most common type.

However, I would love to hear some advice on how fellow RD’s work with their residents who have T2DM and obesity, (sometimes even CHF) and a whole lot of non compliance. 

I am working so hard with a few residents and the food service director to manage residents  who constantly have high blood sugar levels. 

How do you all counsel your diabetic residents? What seems to work?

dietetics,"Feeling a bit overwhelmed as a new graduate in clinical dietetics. I finally got a job a few weeks ago in a hospital and have been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. It's my first job since I graduated and I haven't had any other experience since. The first ward I was put on was managing eating disorder patients, which I thought was an area that was too complex for a new graduate, but I managed to get through it. I've now been rotated to general medicine where I am covering three wards, since the eating disorder dietitian has returned from leave. 

I had one shift in gem med on Friday before the weekend and managed to get through my caseload, but had to stay back quite late because of new referrals and I needed to set them up for the weekend. I was pretty happy with myself, but I received a call from my manager who gave me some very vague ""feedback"". She was concerned about how I was performing because she had heard from the wards I covering that I was not appearing to be too confident/not too sure what I was doing. It hurt my confidence a bit because everyone on the wards seemed so friendly and understanding that it was my first time on these wards, so I'm not sure what I did that would warrant feedback being given to my manager. If I had done something clinically incorrect I thought I would have been notified about that specifically.   


I feel like I'm not performing too well but am not sure if I'm just being too hard on myself and if the expectations my manager has of me are a bit unrealistic. I've only been working 2-3 shifts a week for 3 weeks and I'm not only getting use to all the new people, different types of cases but the entire hospital as well. It's a very different hospital to where I did my prac. And I feel really anxious about going to work now because of the feedback I have been given. I'm the only dietitian covering those 3 general medicine wards and I feel like I still have a lot to learn, but my manager being concerned about how I am performing after only doing a few shifts is putting a lot of pressure on me.",Feeling a bit overwhelmed as a new graduate in clinical dietetics.,"I finally got a job a few weeks ago in a hospital and have been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately.

I have cried like 4/5 days this week (post work lol but i am NOT a crier generally) just due to stress and feeling overwhelmed I guess. I change preceptors each week and I think that's a big stressor in the sense that it means different expectations/standards each week (especially with the type A personalities of RDs).

I know that will help me learn but it also just makes me feel like a failure.

dietetics,"Advice on my future Hello fellow dieticians 

I need some advice regarding a master I want to do. 

Lets start from the beginning. In high school I was always a hyperactive, attention seeking kid that couldn’t stay out of trouble. Eventually I was expelled from high school and was sent to a intermediate vocational education which prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, traditionally non-academic, and totally related to a specific trade, occupation, or vocation. I live in the Netherlands so the school systems are different. I’ll try to explain them as best as I can.

Anyhow I finished this education in 2 years and of I went to a university in applied sciences (This isn’t university yet, its less theoretical. In american standards its comparable to college). At first I chose a workingfield related to my prior education, which was in the legal services field. After like 5 months in my first year I realized that it just didn’t suit me. So I dropped out. Afterwards I started the study to become a physical therapist which I also dropped out of because it was in a different city than I lived in. The distance was pressing and I was like 20-21 and not really motivated to put in the work that was needed.( I really matured around my 23rd year). Around that time I started being more social and outgoing etc etc. and I do feel that that was where I started maturing. So I quit again. The year after physical therapy, I started in Nutrition and Dietetics. Which I sticked to. I am now in my final year and I plan on finishing it. Keep in mind, I chose these studies in my earlier twenties without knowing what I wanted. I just chose for the sake of studying, as my parents and environment wanted me to study.

During the first year of my dietetics study I started researching more. Thinking for myself instead of listening to the ‘’wiser’’ older people around me. I quickly found out that religion was a manmade construct. (I was raised in a muslim family). I started researching certain fields like evolution, biology, physics, chemistry, history etc. etc. I started developing. Now I am a 24 year old with decent knowledge about these subjects, thanks to myself. I have finally found myself in a state wherein I can make my own decisions. During my quest for answers I stumbled on the evolutional theory and biology, like I mentioned before. These have been my main interests for a while now and I have been reading a lot about it. Its amazing how we can predict animal and human behaviour, how are genes influence the ways we act and how these fields can answer big philosophical questions. I will start a minor about evolutionary psychobiology in my next semester so I am really stoked about that.

Here is my problem: I finally found what I want to do with my future. Best case scenario? Become a professor/teacher in the field of evolutionary biology. I want to study a biology master and major in evolutionary biology but the problem is that I cannot apply for a masters program in this field because of my prior education. Even with a pre-master they do not accept it. So now I am at this crossroad where I want to pursue my dreams and the field in science that I literally love but I am being blocked by this bureaucratic nonsense. I can’t do what I want to do because of the fact that my teachers in high school didn’t see me as worthy of their time. I will not accept this.

dietetics,"Looking to prepare the best I can for grad school. Tips/advice? Hello! 

I’m currently a rising sophomore pre nutrition major at UNC Chapel Hill. I just switched from a BA in psych so I’m starting all my science courses this year and am pretty behind for getting into the major. I’m trying to be proactive and am planning on adding a few courses in advanced science (as the BSPH is preparing you for a graduate degree in public health and skips out on a few requirements of a DPD), but wanted to know what else I should do to be as competitive as I can for grad school, outside of GPA. I am planning to go into sports nutrition but definitely would like experience in ED’s as well. 

Right now, my top choices are the coordinated program at Utah and Michigan’s MS followed by the Michigan Medicine DI. I currently work 30ish hours a week at Chipotle, interned at the sports nutrition program at my last school and plan to do something similar at UNC.

dietetics,"Conundrum - ARFID vs. Digestive I have a referral for a patient with gastritis and a previously-bleeding (now healing) gastric erosion. The patient is a young adult, and has been underweight for the majority of their life, but has gradually dropped to a BMI of 13.7 over the course of this year due to an exacerbation of symptoms (loss of appetite, stomach pain, and diarrhea). 

Supposedly, the reason for the referral is due to the client having an immense fear of branching out from foods that don’t exacerbate symptoms (cooked vegetables, cooked poultry &amp; fish, fruit, and nut butters). In the past, they have experienced worsening symptoms when eating beans, dairy, and fibrous grains. However, their current “safe” diet is currently insufficient to support weight stabilization. 

Although I have experience working with EDs, I feel a bit at a crossroads. I am unsure if this case truly qualifies as ARFID, if the patient has reported difficulty digesting these foods in the past. At the same time, it seems as though fear of symptoms may be holding them back from trying foods that may have caused just one bad experience. 

Would you approach this as more of an ARFID case, working with the patient to reintroduce foods? Or would you approach it as a digestive case, working with the patient to increase calories based on tolerated items?",Conundrum - ARFID vs. Digestive,"I have a referral for a patient with gastritis and a previously-bleeding (now healing) gastric erosion.

Last week, I had a call with a woman who has high cholesterol levels and throughout the call I gave her many diet recommendations and tips surrounding getting enough fiber, limiting refined carb intake, not overdoing sodium and swapping out saturated fat foods for various unsaturated options. 

She sent me an email afterwards essentially saying she doesn’t want anymore calls with me and that I’m not a good dietitian due to my saturated fat recommendation. She sent me several articles/research that suggest that saturated fat intake doesn’t affect heart health.   I sent her various links from eatright.org, dietary guidelines 2015-2020, and some research articles that suggest subbing saturated fat with unsaturated fat can reduce CVD risk. She then basically asked me if I’m just blindly following what the academy says and that any claim I made to her on the call wasn’t backed up by enough literature for her to trust my judgement 

Does anyone have any comments on this? Was I in the wrong for my suggestion?

dietetics,"Current Nursing School student... thinking of switching to Dietetics and Nutrition major Hi all! 

I am currently enrolled in a nursing (BSN) program in California, USA. However, I’m not in love with the program. Like anything they say education is bound to have its ups and downs, but something doesn’t sit right with me about the approach to medicine and the general nurse culture (very dark humor, most hate their jobs or make jokes about hating their jobs, the long hours, mean preceptors, etc). The work is also something i thought i would love, and although i don’t hate it, it’s hard to imagine myself actually doing it for the rest of my life. 

I am keenly interested in dietetics. I have always had a deep interest in nutrition science and it’s application, but hadn’t considered making a career out of it until the past year when the thought of being in nursing has become increasingly hard to handle. Sadly, I switched to nursing after already opting out of a completely different major field in a completely different university. Beginning the road to nutrition would be my THIRD attempt at a freakin bachelors degree. However I think nutrition is really my passion, and I may want to go on to become a naturopathic doctor focusing on nutrition and digestive health later on once I’ve worked in the field for a while. 

Has anyone in this subreddit gone down this path? Perhaps from RN to RD or similar? Does anyone have advice or insight into these programs? How do you like your job?

Ps— there is some overlap in curriculum so I wouldn’t be set too far back. I have taken classes such as gen chemistry, anatomy, physiology, human biology, etc. I’m also a straight A student, and excel in math and science so I don’t think the nutrition program would pose too much problem for me academically.

I have yet another LTC question but I guess this could apply to anywhere that enters weights in to a computer system. Everyone on here has been so helpful and I don’t know where I would be without you guys &lt;3

So, I have been entering the weights into Point Click Care as the nurses give them to me. We have a real problem with large weight loss, broken scales, and reweighs taking forever (like 3+ weeks sometimes) to get done. So when I get a weight from a nurse that clearly needs a reweigh, I put it in the computer, tell the nurse I need a reweigh, and make a little note saying “discrepancy noted, will obtain reweigh”. But sometimes despite my best efforts and telling the DON, the reweighs don’t get done for a while. 

I was recently told to not put in any weights that need a reweigh until the reweigh is done which would be fine under normal circumstances but I would feel weird back dating a weight for last month when the reweigh is finally done and then it being not addressed. Or sometimes the reweigh is off by twenty pounds in another direction and then I have to wait forever to reweigh again. If the reweigh ever shows the first weight was in innacurate, I cross it out and make a little note. I offered to wait up to 72 hours after a weigh for a reweigh to get done but the admin said that wasn’t enough. 

Ugh, I’m really struggling with what’s the right solution! Obviously putting in unverified data isn’t ideal but I feel like documenting it is still important because the patient frequently did lose 20lbs and it’s important to know when that actually occurred.",Waiting to enter weights,"

How do I approach them to possibly work for them?

I'm excited for this opportunity, but I am feeling in over my head. Aside from some clinical assessments (which I'm comfortable with), a big part of my new role is to develop community programs. I've never done this and I'm not getting any help. I was expecting to overlap a bit with the dietitian who is leaving and get some cursory training or ideas, but due to the current situation in the world it didn't happen.

I need to develop programs for a community that is largely vulnerable with lower socio-economic status and many challenges with food insecurity. I have a meeting on Monday where I am meant to present my ideas. I HAVE NONE. :-( So far in my career, I've done a LOT of one-on-one consulting and that's IT.

Abstract:
The recommendation to limit dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake has persisted despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group, without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, eggs and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD.

dietetics,"Need Advice on Outpatient Diabetes Educator Job  

TL;DR - Should I go on a leave from my job as a diabetes educator until the practice is actually ready for me?

I started working for a large primary care practice as a dietitian/diabetes educator in March, right before everything shut down. I worked for about 2 weeks in the beginning of March, before being furloughed, and recently returned to work in the beginning of June. I was hired to work 2 days a week, with room for growth.

There is a consultant who functions as the practice manager, who has been my point person/""boss"" (?) since I have began working there. My issue is that she has not done the necessary groundwork to establish a functional nutrition education program, and has instead has focused on billing and credentialing. For example, there is no referral system. The doctors refer anyone they think needs a dietitian (which is pretty much everyone), even though she wants me to only see diabetic patients for now. The practice sees about 200 patients a day, and it is literally impossible for me to see everyone that is referred to me. I keep asking the manager if she needs help establishing a clear referral system, but she just says she'll let the doctors know on her own. Another issue is that I don't have a proper space to see patients. They put me in a tiny spare exam room, with only a laptop and stool. There is no printer to print diet education, not even a desk to properly write on. I keep complaining to her about these limitations, but she keeps telling me to be patient while they set up my space. There is also no clear system for follow-up; the office staff just schedules people as they see fit. There is no communication between myself, the staff and the physicians. Everything goes through her, but she is terrible at communication. I truly believe that she rushed to hire me before getting things set up, and now that I'm there, she hasn't prioritized getting me a proper structure and set up.

I have been an outpatient dietitian pretty much my whole career, so I am very familiar with what it takes to establish a proper nutrition education program. When I returned in the beginning of June, I sent her a lengthy email basically outlining what I mentioned above, and told her I'd be more than happy to assist her in implementing these things, and if we couldn't do that, then I wouldn't return to work until they were in place. She emailed me back, and met with me in person assuring me that these things would be done, but so far nothing has been done.

Based on the things I mentioned above, would you be patient and stick it out, or let her know you'll be going back on leave, and will return when you have a proper space and program? Let me add - I also work part-time in LTC, so I don't need the money, but I do really enjoy nutrition counseling and the job has great potential.

dietetics,"LTC: Ethical differences between withholding/withdrawing feeding Hey guys, 

I'm having a difficult time with an assignment so I was hoping to get some real world experience on the topic. 

Is there an ethical difference between withdrawing or withholding feeding from a PVS pt and an adv. dementia pt that is refusing food and fluids. I was assigned yes.

0000

ETA (as I learn)
Beneficence: duty to to all that will benefit the patient and take positive steps to prevent/remove harm

Nonmaleficence: not intentionally cause harm.

Research findings: putting a patient with advance dementia on EN doesn't prolong life nor lower aspiration risk and will likely result in them becoming bedridden (ESPEN guidelines)

No evidence of medical benefit from feeding in adv dementia  and feeding tubes may cause harm. It is ethnically permissible to withhold feeding (Alzheimer's association)

Altertness major ethical consideration 


0000

The major differences I can see are 

religious: like in Judaism and Islam it is considered euthanasia if a pt is put on EN and then it is withdrawn and feeding isn't seen as desirable in the first place. 

benefit vs burden: in the pt with dementia EN isn't shown to prolong life and can increase discomfort by increased risk of aspiration

family belief: withholding feeding could mean not doing everything possible to provide care for pt with adv dementia while withdrawing would be acceptance that everything possible was done for the PVS pt.

Everything else seems to align that there is no ethical difference.  I'm also having difficulty accepting that because my grandmother is starting to refuse foods and liquids.

Is there an ethical difference between withdrawing or withholding feeding from a PVS pt and an adv. dementia pt that is refusing food and fluids. I was assigned yes.

0000

ETA (as I learn)
Beneficence: duty to to all that will benefit the patient and take positive steps to prevent/remove harm

Nonmaleficence: not intentionally cause harm.

Research findings: putting a patient with advance dementia on EN doesn't prolong life nor lower aspiration risk and will likely result in them becoming bedridden (ESPEN guidelines)

No evidence of medical benefit from feeding in adv dementia  and feeding tubes may cause harm. It is ethnically permissible to withhold feeding (Alzheimer's association)

Altertness major ethical consideration 


0000

The major differences I can see are 

religious: like in Judaism and Islam it is considered euthanasia if a pt is put on EN and then it is withdrawn and feeding isn't seen as desirable in the first place. 

benefit vs burden: in the pt with dementia EN isn't shown to prolong life and can increase discomfort by increased risk of aspiration

family belief: withholding feeding could mean not doing everything possible to provide care for pt with adv dementia while withdrawing would be acceptance that everything possible was done for the PVS pt.

Everything else seems to align that there is no ethical difference.  I'm also having difficulty accepting that because my grandmother is starting to refuse foods and liquids.

dietetics,"How do you, as a dietitian, manage family conversations about weight loss and dieting? This might be more of a r/relationships question, but I really want a dietitian perspective! 

I love my boyfriends mom so much, she’s sweet, intelligent, introverted like me, and I really admire her for many reasons. 
However, she has a lot of engrained diet culture attitudes and it makes me really sad, but I don’t know what to do about it.
She lost a bunch of weight from 2+ hours of treadmill walking a day during covid19, is proud to be back to the weight she was on her wedding day, and only allows herself plain popcorn and dark chocolate as a treat. She has not missed a day on the treadmill since March 13.
She frequently tells me about her diet accomplishments, and I think she’s looking for validating/ congrats from me (as I am a dietitian).
I don’t want to say “congrats” or “that’s great”, because I really don’t think it’s great to unnecessarily restrict yourself. I have no idea what to say, so I just say “wow” or ...nothing at all. 
I want to point out that it’s a huge privilege to be able to focus on weight loss during a global pandemic, but I’ve only been dating her son 1.5 years and I wouldn’t say I know her on a deep level quite yet. 
She was already a very slender woman/low end of BMI before this!
I just worry about what she will think of me if I gain weight when I have children someday, or if she will think I’m less of a dietitian if my body fluctuates throughout my life. 
I truly take a weight-neutral approach to being a dietitian, and I help my patients eat and exercise intuitively (I do the same for myself). It makes me really happy to have the skills to listen to my body’s needs, including taking a break from the gym on days my body needs rest. 

If you read all the way through this, any blog posts or tips to help with this topic? Or good responses when diet-culture talk comes up at the dinner table?

This is an inpatient clinical case study on a kidney transplant patient, post-transplant.

Include a transcript of communication, identify who you are communicating to, and indicate through what outlet that information would be communicated.""

I'm honestly not sure where to start - would it be an e-mail or a portal message (assuming the patient is going to an outpatient RDN in the same network)? I never had any referral experience during my on-site rotations. I also tried reaching out to my preceptor, and she didn't offer much guidance outside of that she didn't have any specific references to use.

dietetics,"Conflict of Interest for private practice RDs Hey everyone, I’ve gone down a rabbit hole with researching potential conflicts of interest and hoping someone on here may have some input. I work part time as an inpatient dietitian at a hospital and started my own private practice that just recently (like within the past couple weeks) has been fully good to go with accepting insurance.

So my question is, where do I need to tread lightly when it comes to promoting myself? Two scenarios come to mind. 1) attached to our hospital is a clinic with a gastroenterology office. I’d love to bring my referral pad to them also, but not sure if this is a conflict of interest since they are owned by the same company as the hospital.

Bonus points also if anyone knows when billing insurance if I’m required to have a photo copy of the patient’s drivers license and health insurance card in their EMR? I obviously have their insurance info already on file, but do I need a picture of the card?

Thanks for any input!!",2020-06-12 07:01:56

I recently changed jobs moving from a food service, team based position to starting my own private practice. A lot of my portfolio's current goals are pretty irrelevant to what I'm now doing.

So I've got a few questions to anyone who has done this before:

1. Should I NOT update my portfolio? I have over the needed 75 hours and have 3 more years until my cycle ends.

One is a small company started by a dietitian. I’d be covering 8 long term care locations to provide MNT and perform kitchen sanitation surveys. I would be the only RD in that region that works for them. 18 work days a month, $27 an hour, 32-34hr/week (45,000-47,700). Health insurance, visit dental and 401K. They have PTO but prob not much since I’m already off 4-5 days a month on top of weekends. They apparently offer lots of education opportunities. For a starting RD, you can learn a lot pretty quickly. However, that area is more expensive to live in (1 bed apartment is about $800+ utilities) 

The other one is a rehab building attached to an acute hospital covered by a large food and nutrition contract company that hires thousands of dietitians. I would be covering about 60 beds in the rehab/post acute building and cover acute buildings one weekend out of a month. 40 hrs a week, 49k. There are 4 other RDs in the acute care building. All sorts of benefits on top of health insurance, vision, dental, PTO, holidays and 401k. Many I don’t see myself having the need for for years down the line. They do offer education opportunities as well but they do not seem to push for RDs to grow. This area is a small city with kind of high crime rates (407 in 2018, 274 is the national average). It’s cheaper to live in too. A 1 bed room apartment is about $600+ utilities. 

I personally favor the first one that paid less but has expedited growth since I’m brand new. With experience, I could get better positions in the future. Saving money right now is not a huge priority of mine. Although I can’t tell if the pay is not that great for that position. I used the salary calculator and it’s just below what it suggested (48,900). Since I have so little time, should I ask for more? 

TLDR; 

New RD. One job paid less, long term care and some food service, more expensive area, less benefits, expedited growth, 47,700/ year. The other paid more, rehab and occasional acute care.

She was started on a fluid restriction and given kayaxalate. A week later her Creat is WNL, her BUN is still elevated but down 20 points, her Na and K are WNL.

&gt; # History of the American Dietetic Association’s Vegetarian Position Papers, Part One: Why Seventh-day Adventists Want to Prove That Vegetarianism is the Healthiest Diet, and How They Influenced the ADA/Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
&gt; 
&gt; **_Editor’s note: Almost everything in this entry is a quote, because I wanted to let Adventists do all the explaining.** The names that initially appear in bold, aside from those in headlines, are Adventists who would later review American Dietetic Association vegetarian position papers. (Though there are other Adventist reviewers and authors of ADA vegetarian position papers who are not mentioned in this entry.)_
&gt; 
&gt;---

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; For more than 130 years Seventh-day Adventists (SDAs) have practiced a vegetarian dietary lifestyle because of their belief in the holistic nature of humankind. Whatever is done in eating or drinking should honor and glorify God and preserve the health of the body, mind and spirit.

&gt; &gt; Ellen White [prophet of Seventh-day Adventism] received her first major health reform vision, June 6, 1863, in the home of Aaron Milliard, at Otsego, Michigan. In this vision, for the first time, God’s people were urged to abstain from flesh food in general and from swine’s flesh in particular. Ellen White characterized this vision as “great light from the Lord,” adding, “I did not seek this light; I did not study to obtain it; it was given to me by the Lord to give to others.”

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; God did not call upon this advent movement to do so unusual a thing as to build medical institutions as well as churches, and to train doctors and nurses as well as ministers and Bible instructors, just because He desired these doctors and nurses to care only for the bodies of men. Such care can be given in numerous hospitals in the land, and in some instances better care may be possible because of huge endowments and special equipment. But God called upon us to foster medical work because, rightly carried on, it can play a part in the divine plan for the salvation of men. The medical and ministerial are not two separate and distinct lines of activity. They are parts of one whole, and the link that connects them and provides the full justification for a medical side to this religious movement, is the fact that all physical woes and maladies are a by-product of our sinful state. The kind of service you render to the cause of God and to suffering humanity will help to reveal whether the goal of Adventist medical work is being maintained.

&gt; # History of the American Dietetic Association’s Vegetarian Position Papers, Part One: Why Seventh-day Adventists Want to Prove That Vegetarianism is the Healthiest Diet, and How They Influenced the ADA/Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
&gt; 
&gt; **_Editor’s note: Almost everything in this entry is a quote, because I wanted to let Adventists do all the explaining.** The names that initially appear in bold, aside from those in headlines, are Adventists who would later review American Dietetic Association vegetarian position papers. (Though there are other Adventist reviewers and authors of ADA vegetarian position papers who are not mentioned in this entry.)_
&gt; 
&gt;---

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; For more than 130 years Seventh-day Adventists (SDAs) have practiced a vegetarian dietary lifestyle because of their belief in the holistic nature of humankind. Whatever is done in eating or drinking should honor and glorify God and preserve the health of the body, mind and spirit.

&gt; &gt; Ellen White [prophet of Seventh-day Adventism] received her first major health reform vision, June 6, 1863, in the home of Aaron Milliard, at Otsego, Michigan. In this vision, for the first time, God’s people were urged to abstain from flesh food in general and from swine’s flesh in particular. Ellen White characterized this vision as “great light from the Lord,” adding, “I did not seek this light; I did not study to obtain it; it was given to me by the Lord to give to others.”

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; God did not call upon this advent movement to do so unusual a thing as to build medical institutions as well as churches, and to train doctors and nurses as well as ministers and Bible instructors, just because He desired these doctors and nurses to care only for the bodies of men. Such care can be given in numerous hospitals in the land, and in some instances better care may be possible because of huge endowments and special equipment. But God called upon us to foster medical work because, rightly carried on, it can play a part in the divine plan for the salvation of men. The medical and ministerial are not two separate and distinct lines of activity. They are parts of one whole, and the link that connects them and provides the full justification for a medical side to this religious movement, is the fact that all physical woes and maladies are a by-product of our sinful state. The kind of service you render to the cause of God and to suffering humanity will help to reveal whether the goal of Adventist medical work is being maintained.

&gt; # The Global Influence of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church on Diet
&gt; 
&gt; **Abstract**
&gt; 
&gt; The emphasis on health ministry within the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) movement led to the development of sanitariums in mid-nineteenth century America. These facilities, the most notable being in Battle Creek, Michigan, initiated the development of vegetarian foods, such as breakfast cereals and analogue meats. **The SDA Church still operates a handful of food production facilities around the world.** The first Battle Creek Sanitarium dietitian was co-founder of the American Dietetics Association which ultimately advocated a vegetarian diet. **The SDA Church established hundreds of hospitals, colleges, and secondary schools and tens of thousands of churches around the world, all promoting a vegetarian diet.** As part of the ‘health message,’ diet continues to be an important aspect of the church’s evangelistic efforts. In addition to promoting a vegetarian diet and abstinence from alcohol, **the SDA church has also invested resources in demonstrating the health benefits of these practices through research. Much of that research has been conducted at Loma Linda University** in southern California, where there have been three prospective cohort studies conducted over 50 years. The present study, Adventist Health Study-2, enrolled 96,194 Adventists throughout North America in 2003–2004 with funding from the National Institutes of Health. Adventist Health Studies have demonstrated that a vegetarian diet is associated with longer life and better health.

I recently read an article about the food served in various facilities throughout the US, and it literally hurts to see the way that incarcerated people are being fed. It makes me SO angry that not only are there issues with food-borne illness, spoiled foods, pests, etc., but there is obviously a preference for lowering costs over providing adequate nutrition. 

Healthy food and adequate amounts of food are basic human rights in my opinion and incarcerated people are being denied this. Think of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. How do we expect these people to improve themselves and reach ""self-actualization"" when their basic human needs are not met? We are setting them up for disease and malnutrition. 

As nutrition professionals, I think we are in a perfect position to advocate for them, and that is something I am incredibly interested in exploring. If you don't agree that incarcerated people deserve adequate nutrition, just keep scrolling. But for those of you that agree, please let me know how I can best help!",Prison Food Reform,"Hi everyone!

Hey everyone!

I  recently finished my DI and am taking my RD exam in the next month! So  naturally, I have been hunting for jobs online. However, it seems that  there are no RD jobs anywhere, at least not for new grads. Most places  seem to require 2+ years. I was told that interns typically get job  offers from where they had their rotations, but my rotations either had  only 1 RD on staff (SNF), required 1 year clinical (dialysis), or simply  are not hiring due to drastic reduction in census from certain events I cannot name (or the post will get deleted from Mods).

What  should I do? I've applied to jobs that would accept 'RD eligible  candidates,' but was flat out told they are not hiring new grads. And  others I have not heard back from at all. It is definitely frustrating  because I want to work, but I also really need money to pay for student  loans. I'm at a crossroads. Should I take a job not related to the  dietetics field requiring little experience so I can earn a paycheck?  How long did it take others to finally get hired after their internship?

dietetics,"MNT Resource Recs? I finally made an account to post on here after being a longtime lurker. I'm an RD working in the corporate wellness/counseling area for about 2 years now and I recently picked up a PRN clinical spot for 1-2 weekend days a month. My main goal is to refresh my clinical skills - it's been 3 years since my DI and I don't want them to get rusty. My DI also wasn't the most focused on clinical (met the req hrs, but that's about it). 

My request here is - what are your go-to resources for MNT? I shadowed a day or so, worked alongside the team for a day or so, and have been working alone since. I'm not confident in my skills yet and have been taking a reeeeally long time to do even just a small case load. I understand that each hospital/employer has different protocols/resources as well - I'm just curious as to what was helpful as an intro/getting your feet wet and getting more comfortable with the process.

dietetics,"Advice please? I'm looking for some advice and/or a little bit of validation here, and I appreciate it ahead of time. Everyone in this sub has always been really kind and helpful to me, so I thought I would post this here. 
 

 Long story short, I was an ED patient and had type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's thyroditis diagnoses when I was a young adult and it put me on the career path to become an RDN CDE. I still struggle with weight problems, (about 50 pounds overweight) due to my conditions. There are a couple colleagues of mine in particular who have been putting me down because of the fact that I'm an overweight nutritionist, soon to be dietician.
 Of course I'm working very hard and my weight management is between my doctors and myself. But it got me thinking about things and is making me rethink this path. I feel like if I'm not skinny and eat perfectly all the time, I will not be taken seriously by my patients or colleagues. 

I've been bullied my whole life for various things, so I've had quite a bit of experience with that. However I've never experienced bullying in a professional setting, especially from my own peers who have dedicated their time and money to becoming a professional who is supposed to know about and help people with my conditions. I suppose I just need some encouragement. Thank you for reading!",Advice please?,"I'm looking for some advice and/or a little bit of validation here, and I appreciate it ahead of time.

dietetics,"An analysis of the previous thread about salaries So it seemed like some folks were interested in an analysis of one of the previous threads ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/gmnesv/i_saw_this_thread_in_a_behavioral_therapist/)) about salaries, so I basically did that and got the results [HERE](https://i.imgur.com/7CioOVg.png).

For those that aren't interested in modeling, skip the italicized sections. 

*Below is how I dealt with the data*

* *Location*
   * *grouped peoples' states into general regions (CA/Washington state/etc belonging to the ""west coast"", e.g., Connecticut and New Jersey belonging to the Northeast, Texas/AL/Florida/etc. being the South, CO being the ""Mountains"", etc.)*
* *Education*
   * *made the BS and MS/MPH a dichotomous variable*
* *Specialty*
   * *made groupings within ""specialty"" that I deemed related (e.g., sports nutrition sales and other forms of specialties with the word ""sales"" in it being ""sales""*
* *Salary*
   * *converted any hourly rates into a salary by multiplying the hourly rate \* hours worked per week \* 52 weeks, and kept experience numeric (e.g., 6 months = .5 years).*

*I didn't do the following: 1) adjust for cost of living and 2) further sub-categorize peoples' locations into metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan areas. Other caveats are the 1) sample size and 2) the lack of accounting for cost of living and different areas 3) any sort of overlap between factors like ""acute"" and ""inpatient"" and 4) the fact that salaried employees probably receive benefits beyond just salary that aren't included in this model. I plugged this into a multivariate linear regression.* 

**As for the results, here's a** [**table**](https://i.imgur.com/aeBfmvo.png) **of the model + cofficients and here's** [**the graph again**](https://i.imgur.com/7CioOVg.png)**\*. The mean salary was \~$47k and two factors were stat. significant for increasing the salary, working on the west coast &amp; having more years of experience (the increase for each year of experience is $2.7k). Another interesting thing about this is that education, probably because it's an entry-way to dietetics, didn't have any effect/correlation on/with salary.**

What do you think? Maybe this confirms what you already know!

dietetics,"Calories out - a question of differences between althletes I couldn't think of where to ask this question but maybe there are some sports forward Dieticians that can help me understand this here.  Sorry to bore all you clinical kids with this. =p   


I have been wondering about Calories out and measurement - work done from an external point of view and how sports trackers actually estimate the calories spent during an activity. 

Here's the framework. I have a female friend who is a life long athlete and is extremely fit. Her resting heart-rate is one of those low 40 BPM ones and she rarely goes past zone 4 training zone with me when exercising.  She is about 30 lbs lighter then me and we are both 40-45 age range (she's slightly older).

I also have a naturally low resting heart rate sub 50 but I have no problem at all getting into high zones(1/2/3) as I am less strong with Cardio. Also I am male.

If we do the same exercise together she will be estimated at say 500 calories out but I will be estimated at say 1500 Calories out.  If we've done the same ""work"" (from an external point of view) how can we really have a difference of 3 times the energy spent?",Calories out - a question of differences between althletes,"I couldn't think of where to ask this question but maybe there are some sports forward Dieticians that can help me understand this here.

dietetics,"A few quick questions regarding ONS If it matters, I'm a DTR in a SNF.

1. Is Juven supposed to be used for short term, like 2 weeks? We have multiple residents who are on Juvem BID with no end date for wound healing, I guess until the wound heals?

2. Are there any nutritional interventions (protein, oral zinc) for diabetic ulcers, especially persistent or reoccurring ulcers? My facility frequently uses Juven or Pro-Stat AWC for diabetic ulcers.

3. And not ONS related, but I have a resident who is puree, extremely thick (pudding thick) for long term because he refuses tube feeding. I'm worried he's not getting enough fluids, although he does get at least 480mL in Mighty Shakes and 720mL in fluids on his tray. Basically he's my buddy and I'm worried about him, do you have any suggestions besides stopping by frequently with (extremely thick) fluids?

With only doing the DI I won’t be eligible for financial aid or student loans of course, but the masters programs at the University don’t really match with what I had in mind (I knew this when applying but the DI seems perfect and I’m so excited to start✨). The only one I have considered at the University that I will be completing my DI at is masters of public health which seems cool but my original plan was to do my DI and then go back to school for MS in either food science or food engineering.

dietetics,"Confused and stressed DPD student trying to figure out applying for the DI I wanted to first say that I apologize for the lengthy post but I've got quite a few questions about the DI application process and figuring out where to apply. 

I am currently an incoming senior at my school's DPD, and with the start of summer, I figured I should start taking a look at the AGSP sooner than later. One thing I started looking for right off the bat was programs that have low min. science GPAs because I'm certain this will be the weakest part of my application (my science GPA really is pretty horrible, being just below a 3.0). I've had no issue finding programs that are at or even decently below that minimum I need, but then comes a bunch of other factors that need to be taken into consideration. Lots of these programs may not necessarily have the concentration I'm interested in (community nutrition, wellness, nutrition education). Then there's the other issue of finding programs that are less competitive in terms of number applying vs. number accepted, and programs that have the ""optimal"" ranking of different application components with regard to potential strength of my personal statement, references, experience, and the different GPAs. 

I should also mention that I'm primarily looking for DI-only options. I know this presents yet another limiting factor, but for myself, I feel it's a much better decision to complete the DI and Master's separately. Whether the Master's or DI comes first likely will come down to if I'm matched next spring. Part of the reason for this is because I'm really interested in completing a Master's of Social Work or a degree centered around Child Development/Family Studies, which are degrees I haven't heard of being offered in combined programs...


Obviously for programs that have a min. science GPA that is too high they would likely not even accept my application, but for those that do have a cutoff that I'd make, what other factors should I be heavily considering? Just as a made up example: a program that has lower competition and/or a favorable ranking of application components, but doesn't have the concentration I'm interested in vs. a program that has higher competition, but has the concentration I'm interested in and/or a more favorable ranking of application components.

Anyways, I apologize for this massively long, rambling post but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to go about narrowing down whatever choices I may have. Simply, I'd really like advice on which factors to weigh more heavily to determine which programs I should be looking at. Thanks if you've read through!!",Confused and stressed DPD student trying to figure out applying for the DI,"I wanted to first say that I apologize for the lengthy post but I've got quite a few questions about the DI application process and figuring out where to apply. 

I am currently an incoming senior at my school's DPD, and with the start of summer, I figured I should start taking a look at the AGSP sooner than later. One thing I started looking for right off the bat was programs that have low min. science GPAs because I'm certain this will be the weakest part of my application (my science GPA really is pretty horrible, being just below a 3.0). I've had no issue finding programs that are at or even decently below that minimum I need, but then comes a bunch of other factors that need to be taken into consideration. Lots of these programs may not necessarily have the concentration I'm interested in (community nutrition, wellness, nutrition education). Then there's the other issue of finding programs that are less competitive in terms of number applying vs. number accepted, and programs that have the ""optimal"" ranking of different application components with regard to potential strength of my personal statement, references, experience, and the different GPAs. 

I should also mention that I'm primarily looking for DI-only options. I know this presents yet another limiting factor, but for myself, I feel it's a much better decision to complete the DI and Master's separately. Whether the Master's or DI comes first likely will come down to if I'm matched next spring. Part of the reason for this is because I'm really interested in completing a Master's of Social Work or a degree centered around Child Development/Family Studies, which are degrees I haven't heard of being offered in combined programs...


Obviously for programs that have a min. science GPA that is too high they would likely not even accept my application, but for those that do have a cutoff that I'd make, what other factors should I be heavily considering? Just as a made up example: a program that has lower competition and/or a favorable ranking of application components, but doesn't have the concentration I'm interested in vs. a program that has higher competition, but has the concentration I'm interested in and/or a more favorable ranking of application components.

Anyways, I apologize for this massively long, rambling post but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to go about narrowing down whatever choices I may have. Simply, I'd really like advice on which factors to weigh more heavily to determine which programs I should be looking at. Thanks if you've read through!!",2020-05-22 19:19:23

The ketogenic diet, colloquially called the keto diet, maybe a popular diet containing high amounts of fats, adequate protein and low carbohydrate. it’s also mentioned as a coffee Carb-High Fat (LCHF) diet and a coffee carbohydrate diet. It was primarily formulated for the treatment of epilepsy that didn’t answer medications for the disease.

The diet was originally published in 1921 by Dr. Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic.

dietetics,"MD placing everyone on a diet The MD at my nursing facility places all of the residents on diets, some are warranted some are not. I always mention in my note why a certain resident receives a certain diet since I fill out the MDS. I usually keep the diets unless there's a reason for the resident to be taken off, such as poor intake or weight loss. For those who fill out the MDS, what would you put down as a reason why the resident is getting the diet if you don't see a good reason for them to be on it? For an example, a lot of the residents are on a 2 gm Na restriction just because they have HTN. I would always use that as a reason but I am now rethinking it since I don't thinks it's good enough.",MD placing everyone on a diet,"The MD at my nursing facility places all of the residents on diets, some are warranted some are not.

dietetics,"“Reweigh pending” problem Hi everyone!
I was recently asked not to write notes stating “reweigh pending” or “requested reweigh for verification”. The issue is that the facility sometimes takes multiple weeks to obtain a reweigh and they believe it “makes them look bad”. However, I want to make sure I address a major weight discrepancy and that it’s documented that I did in fact request a reweigh before assuming someone lost 20lbs in a week. 

Has anything run into this type of situation? It’s such a balance between protecting myself and protecting the facility.

Thanks!!",“Reweigh pending” problem,"Hi everyone!

dietetics,"Brand New RD Job Hunting/ Resume Advice I just passed my CDR exam and got my license set up this week last week. What are some tips you which you had known going into the job market? Especially taking the current lockdown situation into consideration? Most job openings I’ve seen were located more on the rural side which would require 3-7 hours of driving (I don’t mind relocating)

I’m planning to get more clinical experience even though it’s not what I want to end up doing in the long run. I’d prefer a position where I can make long lasting changes in people’s lives whether is government, education, counseling or long term care. Also is recommendation letters from clinical rotations critical? I truly hope not, because my clinical rotation preceptor straight up told me me she did not think I should be an RD. 

Should I have a short description for the types of conditions I’ve treated, or just have a list of the conditions I’ve worked with for the location I’ve interned in? I’m not sure how to make my internship experience condensed and also have descriptions like I had for other jobs (just 2-3 bullet points). 

TLDR; new RD LD, most jobs are at least 3 hours away, importance of reference letters, resume advice",Brand New RD Job Hunting/ Resume Advice,"I just passed my CDR exam and got my license set up this week last week.
